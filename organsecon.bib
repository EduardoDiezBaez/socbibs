		  the organs of a deceased relative. OBJECTIVE: To determine
		  what variables influenced a family's decision to donate.
		  DESIGN: Post hoc investigation using a survey. SETTING:
		  Malaga, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-one people who had
		  been approached for the donation of their deceased
		  relatives' organs at a single hospital. MAIN OUTCOME
		  MEASURE: Consent to donate. RESULTS: Based on a stepwise
		  discriminant function analysis, the following variables
		  played a determining role in a family member's decision to
		  donate: (1) the expressed wish of the deceased, (2) having
		  a clear understanding of the definition of "brain death."
		  (3) the manners and approach of the doctors, (4) the
		  hospital facilities, (5) concerns regarding the donation
		  process, and (6) educational level. CONCLUSION: Prodonation
		  campaigns geared toward the public and hospital staff
		  should focus on specific objectives to increase the
		  likelihood of consent for organ donation},

		  successful tissue and organ transplants and survival rates
		  have dramatically improved. But transplantation has become
		  a victim of its own success. The demand for human organs
		  can no longer be met and deaths of persons on waiting lists
		  have more than doubled since 1988. A number of alternatives
		  have been proposed to fill the gap between the supply and
		  demand of organs and the past few years have seen the
		  development of various approaches derived from recent
		  advances in biotechnology. Among these technologies is
		  xenotransplantation - the transplantation of viable cells,
		  tissues and organs from one animal species to another.
		  Xenotransplantation of cells and tissues has been approved
		  for clinical trials in a number of OECD countries. However,
		  opinions about the risks from these early procedures and
		  whether to proceed any further vary. At the New York 1998
		  Workshop on "International issues in transplantation
		  biotechnology including the use of non-human cells, tissues
		  and organs", world leaders in the field reported on the
		  state of the art and unmet needs in transplantation,
		  addressing in particular the potential, the risks, the
		  ethics and socio-economic impacts of xenotransplantation.
		  Based on presentations, transcripts of round-table
		  discussions and comments raised at the workshop, this book
		  provides an overview of the field and of current regulatory
		  frameworks and addresses the most pressing international
		  policy considerations on xenotransplantation.}

		  for the recipient are a matter for properly informed
		  consent. The other two issues raise more serious problems,
		  however, and it is argued that if we take seriously the
		  risk of transferring new infectious agents from animal to
		  human populations and the interests of donor animals, then
		  a moratorium on xenotransplantation is called for. The
		  paper finds that the recent Nuffield Council and Department

		  donation performance in a geographic region based on
		  readily available data on the hospitals in that region.
		  METHODS: Medical records were reviewed in a stratified
		  random sample of 89 hospitals from 3 regions to attain a
		  baseline of donor potential. Data on a range of hospital
		  characteristics were collected and tested as predictors of
		  donor potential through the use of hierarchical Poisson
		  regression modeling. RESULTS: Five hospital characteristics
		  predicted donor potential: hospital deaths, hospital
		  Medicare case-mix index, total hospital staffed beds,
		  medical school affiliation, and trauma center
		  certification. Regional estimates were attained by
		  aggregating individual hospital estimates. Confidence
		  intervals for these regional estimates indicated that
		  actual donations represented from 28 percent to 44 percent of the
		  potential in the regions studied. CONCLUSIONS: This
		  methodology accurately estimates organ donor potential
		  within 3 geographic regions and lays the foundation for
		  evaluating organ donation effectiveness nationwide.
		  Additional research is needed to test the validity of the
		  model in other geographic regions and to further explore
		  organ donor potential in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds.

		  throughout the cadaveric organ donation process, timely
		  access to the operating theater for surgical recovery of
		  organs and tissues can be one of the most problematic.
		  Delay in recovery adds to cost, risks organ viability, and
		  compounds donor family anguish with compromise to donation
		  consent. METHODS: From March 1 to November 30, 2001, 25
		  cadaveric donors were selected and successfully transferred
		  from local donor critical care units to an off-site
		  facility, which was constructed, equipped, and staffed to
		  allow surgical recovery of organs and tissues. Assessment
		  of the recovery process and outcome results was compared to
		  42 consecutive, hospital-based, organ recoveries within the
		  Mid-American Transplant Services (MTS) organ procurement
		  organization region. RESULTS: Twenty-five MTS-facility and
		  42 hospital organ recoveries were successfully conducted
		  with no technical losses and satisfactory function in all
		  206 transplanted organs. From the MTS donor group, 7
		  hearts, 4 lungs, 21 livers, 28 kidneys, and 5 pancreases
		  were successfully transplanted. Statistically significant
		  in the MTS group was higher donor age (44.1 vs. 30.2
		  years), shorter total donor management time (539 vs. 718
		  min), reduced delay in start of surgery (25 vs. 77 min),
		  shorter cold ischemia time for recovered pancreases (355
		  vs. 630 min), and reduced mean cost per donor (\$10,636 vs.
		  \$12,918). There was no significant difference in race,
		  gender, cause of death, vasopressor requirements, organs
		  per donor recovered (3.12 vs. 3.62) or transplanted (2.60
		  vs. 3.36), rate of tissue recoveries (68% vs. 67%), total
		  operating room time (207 vs. 200 min.), or cold ischemia
		  time (excluding pancreas). CONCLUSIONS: Cadaveric-donor
		  multiorgan and tissue recovery at this hospital-independent
		  facility was successfully accomplished in a manner
		  indistinguishable from conventional hospital organ and
		  tissue recovery. The intended objectives of improved access
		  to the operating theater were realized along with the added
		  benefit of significant cost savings and convenience to
		  hospital personnel and surgical recovery teams. }

		  SETTING: All deaths by cause in the United States during
		  1993-1994 as reported in the Vital Mortality Statistics,
		  Multiple Cause of Death files. The OPO-specific data were
		  provided by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).
		  STUDY DESIGN: Each OPO's expected number of donors was
		  calculated by applying national donation rates to deaths
		  with potential for donation in 24 age, sex, and race cells.
		  The SDR was calculated by dividing the observed number of
		  donors by the expected number. The chi2 tests of the
		  hypothesis that the OPO's performance differed from the
		  national norm of 1.0 were performed. The SDR was compared
		  to the existing performance standard based on the
		  unadjusted number of donors per million live population in
		  the OPO's service area. An ordinary least squares (OLS)
		  regression assessed predictors of the SDR. PRINCIPAL
		  FINDINGS: The SDRs ranged from 0.41 to 1.99. Twenty-nine of
		  64 OPOs had SDRs significantly different than 1.0. The SDRs
		  were positively associated with the percent of white living
		  population and the number of organ types transplanted per
		  transplant center served by the OPO. CONCLUSIONS: The SDRs
		  can be used by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
		  (CMS), UNOS, and OPOs to target quality improvement
		  initiatives, present more accurate comparisons of OPO
		  performance, and develop public policy on the evaluation of
		  the effectiveness of organ procurement efforts. }

		  transplantation. This shortfall is especially remarkable in
		  African American populations. Because the incidence of
		  hypertension (HTN) and associated end-stage renal diseases
		  (ESRD) is 17 times greater in African Americans, this
		  minority group, which comprises only 12 percent of the U.S.
		  population, represents 34 percent of the dialysis population and
		  30 percent of the national kidney waiting list. Furthermore,
		  while black individuals comprise 22-24 percent of kidney
		  recipients, they comprise only 8-11 percent of donors. Because of
		  the histocompatibility differences between the races and
		  because tissue matching is part of the United Network for
		  Organ Sharing (UNOS) allocation formula, African Americans
		  wait twice as long for kidneys as Caucasians. Also, because
		  they get more poorly matched organs, their kidney
		  transplant graft survival is 10-20 percent lower than that for
		  other racial groups. The African American community is
		  unaware of the special needs in members of their own race.
		  Steps must be taken to increase minority awareness of the
		  need for well-matched transplant organs and their
		  involvement in the donation process.},

  optnote	= {OBJECTIVES--To estimate the potential supply of organ
		  donors and to measure the efficiency of organ procurement
		  efforts in the United States. METHODS--A geographic
		  database has been developed consisting of multiple cause of
		  death and sociodemographic data compiled by the National
		  Center for Health Statistics. All deaths are evaluated as
		  to their potential for organ donation. Two classes of
		  potential donors are identified: class 1 estimates are
		  restricted to causes of death involving significant head
		  trauma only, and class 2 estimates include class 1
		  estimates as well as deaths in which brain death was less
		  probable. RESULTS--Over 23,000 people are currently
		  awaiting a kidney, heart, liver, heart-lung, pancreas, or
		  lung transplantation. Donor supply is inadequate, and the
		  number of donors remained unchanged at approximately 4000
		  annually for 1986 through 1989, with a modest 9.1 percent
		  increase in 1990. Between 6900 and 10,700 potential donors
		  are available annually (eg, 28.5 to 43.7 per million
		  population). Depending on the class of donor considered,
		  organ procurement efforts are between 37 percent and 59 percent
		  efficient. Efficiency greatly varies by state and organ
		  procurement organization. CONCLUSIONS--Many more organ
		  donors are available than are being accessed through
		  existing organ procurement efforts. Realistically, it may
		  be possible to increase by 80 percent the number of donors
		  available in the United States (up to 7300 annually). It is
		  conceivable, although unlikely, that the supply of donor
		  organs could achieve a level to meet demand. }

		  organization members obtain cynical knowledge. A study of
		  the priests of a larger American archdiocese offers
		  evidence that discrepancies in their belief systems,
		  associated with age, can be explained successfully by an
		  understanding of the role that cynical knowledge plays in
		  an organization dependent upon commitment to altruistic
		  ends. In any institution characterized by a strong belief
		  system, authority relationships may be threatened to the
		  degree that cynical knowledge is acquired by participants
		  early in their careers. Such breakdowns of authority
		  relationships may become more common with the
		  organizational changes now occurring in many professional

		  financial charges generated during the care of potential
		  solid organ donors who fail to donate after consent has
		  been obtained. A retrospective review of financial and
		  medical records of potential organ donors was done at an
		  urban level 1 trauma center. Total hospital stay (T1+T2)
		  for the group was broken down into the interval between
		  admission and diagnosis of lethality (T1) and between
		  diagnosis of lethality and death (T2). Medical
		  complications occurring during the hospital stay and
		  charges generated during each time interval were
		  abstracted. After consent was obtained, 19 of 53 (36 percent)
		  potential donors failed to donate: 9 of 19 (47 percent) expired
		  prior to legal determination of brain death; 10 patients
		  failed to progress to brain death and were made DNR. Of
		  these, 9 died within 24 hr, 1 survived 16 days; 6 of the 10
		  patients did not meet brain death criteria, and 4 were
		  rejected by the OPO for reasons of infectious risks. There
		  were 3.1+/-1.3 medical complications per patient. T1 was
		  less than 4 hr in 16/19 (84 percent) potential donors and
		  constituted a small percentage of the mean total hospital
		  stay (37+/-10 hr). Charges generated during T1+T2
		  (33,997+/-25,843) and specifically during T2
		  (17,385+/-9453) were considerable. These charges were
		  passed on to patients' families or third party payers
		  though care was directed solely at organ procurement after
		  diagnosis of lethality. We conclude that multiple medical
		  complications are encountered in the care of potential
		  organ donors; total hospital stays are short but expensive;
		  more than 50 percent of charges generated during the total
		  hospital stay arise from care provided after determination
		  of lethality; and the goodwill of families to consent to
		  organ donations of their loved ones appears to carry
		  potential for significant financial burden.}

		  MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 223 early deaths among 5,719
		  trauma patients in a 3-year period were reviewed. This
		  group represented 62 percent of all trauma deaths. RESULTS:
		  Forty-six patients (21 percent) donated 102 vascularized organs
		  and made 66 donations of tissues. Patients with isolated
		  severe head injuries had the highest rate of successful
		  donation (33 percent). Those with severe head injury and another
		  severe organ injury had a lower rate of donation (13 percent),
		  and donation was rare (1 percent) among patients with severe
		  organ injury in the absence of head injury (p < 0.001).
		  There were no organ donors among victims >65 years old or
		  in 64 of 65 patients with a Revised Trauma Score of <2.2.
		  The Revised Trauma Score was significantly higher in organ
		  donors (3.39 vs. 3.07, p < 0.05). The cost-benefit ratio
		  for early deaths was \$6,512 per organ/tissue recovered.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Decisions regarding the resuscitation of
		  trauma patients who have characteristics associated with a
		  recognized low rate of organ donation should be made
		  exclusive of the potential for organ recovery.}

  optannote	= {BACKGROUND: The potential supply of transplantable cadaver
		  kidneys is often expressed as donors per million population
		  (pmp), which ignores some essential factors governing organ
		  donation. METHODS: We performed a modeled analysis of
		  kidney donor extraction rates by age, gender, race, cause
		  of death, geographic region, and year in a cohort of
		  evaluable deaths and actual cadaver donors between the ages
		  of 1 and 65 years (1988-1993). Evaluable death was defined
		  as an in-hospital death in patients between the ages of 1
		  and 65 years whose ICD-9-CM cause of death was not an
		  obvious contraindication to kidney donation. The main
		  outcome measures were the crude donation rate and an
		  adjusted donor extraction rate (DER) per 1000 evaluable
		  deaths. RESULTS: A total of 1.4x10(6) in-hospital deaths
		  produced 300,502 evaluable deaths and 20,575 actual donors.
		  Between 1989 and 1993, DER increased from 61.1 to 75 per
		  1,000 evaluable deaths. DERs were highest among the
		  youngest age groups, declining significantly with age from
		  405.0 to 16.7/1,000 evaluable deaths for age groups 1-10
		  and 56-65 years, respectively. There was a small difference
		  in donors pmp between blacks and whites (15 vs. 18). In
		  contrast, DER was seven times higher in whites compared
		  with blacks (112.5 vs. 16.5/1,000 evaluable deaths;
		  P<0.001). The crude donation rate (per 1,000 evaluable
		  deaths) was high for stroke (604.8) and trauma-related
		  deaths (230.6), resulting in highly efficient donor
		  extraction from these deaths. Region-specific DERs ranged
		  from 49.4 to 83/1,000 evaluable deaths and differed
		  significantly from the corresponding donors pmp.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Estimating kidney donation relative to
		  in-hospital evaluable deaths is a meaningful measure of
		  organ procurement efficiency. Efforts to enhance cadaveric
		  kidney donation should seek to understand and reduce the
		  marked demographic and regional disparity in donor
		  extraction rates. }

  abstract	= {CONTEXT: Efforts to increase organ donation include
		  serious attempts in hospital settings, where unrealized
		  donation potential exists. Research on hospital donation
		  must include understanding organizational as well as
		  patient-specific influences on the donation process.
		  OBJECTIVE: To identify organizational characteristics that
		  distinguish hospitals producing organ donations from those
		  that do not, and to estimate the number of nondonor
		  hospitals with donor potential. DESIGN: Data from the
		  American Hospital Association's 1992 annual survey of
		  hospitals were matched to Organ Procurement and
		  Transplantation Network information from the United Network
		  for Organ Sharing regarding the number of solid-organ
		  donors in 1992. Hospitals with donation capability were
		  identified, based on bed size and factors necessary to
		  produce successful donor maintenance and organ recovery.
		  Based on statistical analyses, organizational
		  characteristics distinguishing donor hospitals from
		  nondonor hospitals were identified. We also compared the
		  number of donors and the number of donor hospitals in 1992
		  and 1996. SETTING: United States. RESULTS: Among all
		  hospitals affiliated with the American Hospital Association
		  (n = 5607), 1214 (22 percent) were identified as donor hospitals
		  (> or = 1 donation in 1992). Of 2333 hospitals with
		  procurement capability, 1268 (54 percent) produced no donors in
		  1992. Based on a multiple logistic regression model, donor
		  hospitals differed from nondonor hospitals by hospital
		  ownership, with municipally owned hospitals more likely and
		  federally owned hospitals less likely to produce donation,
		  compared with for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
		  Other organizational characteristics associated with donor
		  hospitals were level of trauma services, whether the
		  hospital had a transplant surgery program or a hospital
		  ethics committee, and whether it was located in the South
		  Atlantic, Southwest Central, or Pacific regions of the
		  United States. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitals not currently
		  producing organ donations, there is a sizable subgroup with
		  donor potential. This area merits further attention.}

  optannote	= {Several studies have noted the impact of socioeconomic
		  factors on access to expensive medical care, but none of
		  those studies controlled for self-reported health and
		  functional status or attitudes about treatment alternatives
		  when analyses were completed. Because these factors may be
		  correlated with socioeconomic status, the failure to
		  control for them may have led to bias in other studies. The
		  authors merged data from secondary sources with telephone
		  survey data from a national sample of 456 end-stage renal
		  disease patients to show how estimates of the effects of
		  socioeconomic factors change when self-reported health and
		  functional status and attitudes about treatment are
		  incorporated into statistical models. The authors also
		  showed how kidney transplant rates would change if
		  socioeconomic factors no longer influences organ allocation
		  decisions. METHODS: Weibull proportional hazard analyses
		  were used to show relationships between socioeconomic
		  measures and waiting list entry and kidney transplant
		  rates, before versus after accounting for self-reported
		  health and functional status, attitudes about treatment,
		  and other variables. Simulation analyses were used to
		  estimate the number of waiting list spots and transplant
		  operations that would move from economically advantaged to
		  disadvantaged persons if socioeconomics no longer
		  influenced organ allocation decisions. RESULTS:
		  Incorporating information about health and functional
		  status, attitudes about treatment, and other factors into
		  the hazard models often reduced the estimated impact of
		  socioeconomic measures on the odds of (1) being on a
		  waiting list for a cadaver kidney transplant and (2)
		  receiving a transplant. Simulations showed that 30 to 65
		  waiting list spots or transplant operations per 1,000
		  patients would shift from economically advantaged to
		  disadvantaged persons if socioeconomics no longer
		  influenced organ allocation decisions. CONCLUSIONS:
		  Successful efforts to level the playing field would result
		  in substantial redistributions of kidney transplants from
		  economically advantaged to disadvantaged persons.}

		  patient attitudes toward the potential benefits and
		  problems of incentives. Using a structured questionnaire,
		  we interviewed 60 randomly selected patients at three
		  chronic hemodialysis units. Subjects were asked to make an
		  explicit trade-off between maintaining altruism versus
		  increasing the supply of kidneys. They were also asked to
		  make a trade-off between protecting poor families versus
		  increasing the supply of kidneys. In addition, we asked
		  subjects how they thought incentives would affect donation
		  by different types of families. We found that 37 percent of all
		  subjects placed more emphasis on maintaining altruism, 42 percent
		  placed more emphasis on increasing the supply of kidneys,
		  and 22 percent placed an equal emphasis on maintaining altruism
		  and on increasing the supply of kidneys. Similarly, 35 percent of
		  all subjects placed more emphasis on protecting poor
		  families, 33 percent placed more emphasis on increasing the
		  supply of kidneys, and 32 percent placed an equal emphasis on
		  protecting poor families and on increasing the supply of
		  kidneys. Subjects thought financial incentives would
		  greatly increase donation by poor families while having
		  little impact on rich families. In conclusion, even though
		  dialysis patients are likely to benefit from increasing the
		  supply of kidneys, many of them want to maintain altruism
		  and protect poor families even if that means fewer kidneys.
		  These concerns should be addressed in proposals to modify
		  the transplant system.}

  abstract	= {CONTEXT: Transplantation has become the therapy of choice
		  for patients with organ failure. However, the low rate of
		  consent by families of donor-eligible patients is a major
		  limiting factor in the success of organ transplantation.
		  OBJECTIVE: To explore factors associated with the decision
		  to donate among families of potential solid organ donors.
		  DESIGN AND SETTING: Data collection via chart reviews,
		  telephone interviews with health care practitioners (HCPs)
		  or organ procurement organization (OPO) staff, and
		  face-to-face interviews with family for all donor-eligible
		  deaths at 9 trauma hospitals in southwestern Pennsylvania
		  and northeastern Ohio from 1994 to 1999. PARTICIPANTS:
		  Family members, HCPs, and OPO staff involved in the
		  donation decision for 420 donor-eligible patients. MAIN
		  OUTCOME MEASURE: Factors associated with family decision to
		  donate or not donate organs for transplantation. RESULTS: A
		  total of 238 of the 420 cases led to organ donation; 182
		  did not. Univariate analysis revealed numerous factors
		  associated with the donation decision. Multivariable
		  analysis of associated variables revealed that family and
		  patient sociodemographics (ethnicity, patient's age and
		  cause of death) and prior knowledge of the patients' wishes
		  were significantly associated with willingness to donate
		  (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.68; 95 percent confidence interval
		  [CI], 6.55-9.01). Families who discussed more topics and
		  had more conversations about organ donation were more
		  likely to donate (adjusted OR, 5.22; 95 percent CI, 4.32-6.30),
		  as were families with more contact with OPO staff (adjusted
		  OR, 3.08; 95 percent CI, 2.63-3.60) and those who experienced an
		  optimal request pattern (adjusted OR, 2.96; 95 percent CI,
		  2.58-3.40). Socioemotional and communication variables
		  acted as intervening variables. CONCLUSIONS: Public
		  education is needed to modify attitudes about organ
		  donation prior to a donation opportunity. Specific steps
		  can be taken by HCPs and OPO staff to maximize the
		  opportunity to persuade families to donate their relatives'
		  organs. },

		  the disparity in donation rates between men and women
		  remain obscure. We studied this issue by gathering data on
		  family members of living donor allograft recipients at a
		  single large center over a 5-year period (n = 144). By
		  considering all potential donors (spouses and first-degree
		  relatives) within each recipient's immediate family, we
		  determined that men and women are excluded as donors at
		  approximately similar rates on the basis of medical
		  condition or known blood group type A, type B, type O
		  incompatibility, and that a greater percentage of
		  acceptable female donors (28.3 percent) compared with men
		  (20.3 percent) go on to donate a kidney (P: = 0.027). However,
		  when only first-degree relatives are considered, the
		  difference in donation rate between men and women becomes
		  nonsignificant (26.9 percent of women versus 22.2 percent of men; P =
		  0.229). Among spouses, the gender disparity in donation
		  rate is greater (36 percent of wives versus 6.5 percent of husbands who
		  are acceptable donors go on to donate a kidney; P = 0.003).
		  Evidence that economic factors may contribute to the
		  overall gender disparity is also presented. In conclusion,
		  the gender disparity among living kidney donors observed in
		  our population can be largely attributed to an overwhelming
		  predominance of wives among spousal donors. Possible
		  explanations and potential interventions to address
		  underrepresentation of male donors are discussed.},
