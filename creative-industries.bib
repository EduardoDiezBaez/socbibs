                  benefits society through price competition--that is,
                  products and services become less costly as firms
                  vie for consumers. Baumol argues for the importance
                  of systematic innovation within the firm, an arms
                  race in which no firm in an innovating industry
                  dares to fall behind the others in new products and
                  processes, and inter-firm collaboration in the
                  creation and use of innovations. While giving price
                  competition due credit, Baumol stresses that large
                  firms use innovation as a prime competitive
                  weapon. However, as he explains it, firms do not
                  wish to risk too much innovation, because it is
                  costly, and can be made obsolete by rival
                  innovation. So firms have split the difference
                  through the sale of technology licenses and
                  participation in technology-sharing compacts that
                  pay huge dividends to the economy as a whole--and
                  thereby make innovation a routine feature of
                  economic life. This process, in Baumol's view,
                  accounts for the unparalleled growth of modern
                  capitalist economies.}

                  society. The creative economy is defined broadly
                  (echoing Howkins's approach), and so the creative
                  class is a disparate selection of

                  global competition poses a paradox. In theory,
                  location should no longer be a source of competitive
                  advantage. Open global markets, rapid
                  transportation, and high-speed communications should
                  allow any company to source any thing from any place
                  at any time. But in practice, location remains
                  central to competition. Clusters are critical masses in one place of linked
                  industries and institutions --- from suppliers to
                  universities to government agencies ---- that enjoy
                  unusual competitive success in a particular
                  field. The most famous examples are found in Silicon
                  Valley and Hollywood, but clusters dot the world's
                  landscape. The more complex,
                  knowledge-based, and dynamic the world economy
                  becomes, he argues, the more competitive
                  advantage lies in local
                  things--knowledge, relationships, and
                  motivation--that distant rivals cannot replicate. }

                  I.T. can de-skill or re-skill depending on how it is
