# Summary #

The contents of my ../texmf/bibtex/bib directory. 'socbib.bib' is a consolidated bibtex file created by merging a number of bibtex files I've compiled over the years. The content reflects citations in my own work.

The bibtool-rsc folder contains some elementary resource files I used while converting and normalizing the bib file using the bibtool utility.
