                  methodology for estimating potential solid organ
                  donors and measuring donation performance in a
                  geographic region based on readily available data on
                  the hospitals in that region. METHODS: Medical
                  records were reviewed in a stratified random sample
                  of 89 hospitals from 3 regions to attain a baseline
                  of donor potential. Data on a range of hospital
                  characteristics were collected and tested as
                  predictors of donor potential through the use of
                  hierarchical Poisson regression modeling. RESULTS:
                  Five hospital characteristics predicted donor
                  potential: hospital deaths, hospital Medicare
                  case-mix index, total hospital staffed beds, medical
                  school affiliation, and trauma center
                  certification. Regional estimates were attained by
                  aggregating individual hospital
                  estimates. Confidence intervals for these regional
                  estimates indicated that actual donations
                  represented from 28\% to 44\% of the potential in
                  the regions studied. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology
                  accurately estimates organ donor potential within 3
                  geographic regions and lays the foundation for
                  evaluating organ donation effectiveness
                  nationwide. Additional research is needed to test
                  the validity of the model in other geographic
                  regions and to further explore organ donor potential
                  in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds. }

                  throughout the cadaveric organ donation process,
                  timely access to the operating theater for surgical
                  recovery of organs and tissues can be one of the
                  most problematic. Delay in recovery adds to cost,
                  risks organ viability, and compounds donor family
                  anguish with compromise to donation
                  consent. METHODS: From March 1 to November 30, 2001,
                  25 cadaveric donors were selected and successfully
                  transferred from local donor critical care units to
                  an off-site facility, which was constructed,
                  equipped, and staffed to allow surgical recovery of
                  organs and tissues. Assessment of the recovery
                  process and outcome results was compared to 42
                  consecutive, hospital-based, organ recoveries within
                  the Mid-American Transplant Services (MTS) organ
                  procurement organization region. RESULTS:
                  Twenty-five MTS-facility and 42 hospital organ
                  recoveries were successfully conducted with no
                  technical losses and satisfactory function in all
                  206 transplanted organs. From the MTS donor group, 7
                  hearts, 4 lungs, 21 livers, 28 kidneys, and 5
                  pancreases were successfully
                  transplanted. Statistically significant in the MTS
                  group was higher donor age (44.1 vs. 30.2 years),
                  shorter total donor management time (539 vs. 718
                  min), reduced delay in start of surgery (25 vs. 77
                  min), shorter cold ischemia time for recovered
                  pancreases (355 vs. 630 min), and reduced mean cost
                  per donor (\$10,636 vs. \$12,918). There was no
                  significant difference in race, gender, cause of
                  death, vasopressor requirements, organs per donor
                  recovered (3.12 vs. 3.62) or transplanted (2.60
                  vs. 3.36), rate of tissue recoveries (68% vs. 67%),
                  total operating room time (207 vs. 200 min.), or
                  cold ischemia time (excluding
                  pancreas). CONCLUSIONS: Cadaveric-donor multiorgan
                  and tissue recovery at this hospital-independent
                  facility was successfully accomplished in a manner
                  indistinguishable from conventional hospital organ
                  and tissue recovery. The intended objectives of
                  improved access to the operating theater were
                  realized along with the added benefit of significant
                  cost savings and convenience to hospital personnel
                  and surgical recovery teams. }

                  applied to data collected from records at 112
                  hospitals. RESULTS: The odds that a family of a

                  nearly twice those for a family of an African
                  American. The odds of donation also differed by

                  especially remarkable in African American
                  populations. Because the incidence of hypertension
                  (HTN) and associated end-stage renal diseases (ESRD)
                  is 17 times greater in African Americans, this

                  22-24\% of kidney recipients, they comprise only

                  kidney transplant graft survival is 10-20\% lower
                  than that for other racial groups. The African
                  American community is unaware of the special needs
                  in members of their own race. Steps must be taken to
                  increase minority awareness of the need for
                  well-matched transplant organs and their involvement
                  in the donation process.},

                  are restricted to causes of death involving
                  significant head trauma only, and class 2 estimates
                  include class 1 estimates as well as deaths in which
                  brain death was less probable. RESULTS--Over 23,000
                  people are currently awaiting a kidney, heart,
                  liver, heart-lung, pancreas, or lung
                  transplantation. Donor supply is inadequate, and the
                  number of donors remained unchanged at approximately
                  4000 annually for 1986 through 1989, with a modest
                  9.1\% increase in 1990. Between 6900 and 10,700
                  potential donors are available annually (eg, 28.5 to
                  43.7 per million population). Depending on the class
                  of donor considered, organ procurement efforts are
                  between 37\% and 59\% efficient. Efficiency greatly
                  varies by state and organ procurement
                  organization. CONCLUSIONS--Many more organ donors
                  are available than are being accessed through
                  existing organ procurement efforts. Realistically,
                  it may be possible to increase by 80\% the number of
                  donors available in the United States (up to 7300
                  annually). It is conceivable, although unlikely,
                  that the supply of donor organs could achieve a
                  level to meet demand. },

                  the understanding by members of an organization that
                  presumably altruistic procedures or actions of that
                  organization actually serve the purposes of
                  maintaining the legitimacy of existing authority or
                  preserving institutional structure. This paper
                  explores the processes by which organization members
                  obtain cynical knowledge. A study of the priests of
                  a larger American archdiocese offers evidence that
                  discrepancies in their belief systems, associated
                  with age, can be explained successfully by an
                  understanding of the role that cynical knowledge
                  plays in an organization dependent upon commitment
                  to altruistic ends. In any institution characterized
                  by a strong belief system, authority relationships
                  may be threatened to the degree that cynical
                  knowledge is acquired by participants early in their
                  careers. Such breakdowns of authority relationships
                  may become more common with the organizational
                  changes now occurring in many professional

  abstract =	 {CONTEXT: Efforts to increase organ donation include
                  serious attempts in hospital settings, where
                  unrealized donation potential exists. Research on
                  hospital donation must include understanding
                  organizational as well as patient-specific
                  influences on the donation process. OBJECTIVE: To
                  identify organizational characteristics that
                  distinguish hospitals producing organ donations from
                  those that do not, and to estimate the number of
                  nondonor hospitals with donor potential. DESIGN:
                  Data from the American Hospital Association's 1992
                  annual survey of hospitals were matched to Organ
                  Procurement and Transplantation Network information
                  from the United Network for Organ Sharing regarding
                  the number of solid-organ donors in 1992. Hospitals
                  with donation capability were identified, based on
                  bed size and factors necessary to produce successful
                  donor maintenance and organ recovery. Based on
                  statistical analyses, organizational characteristics
                  distinguishing donor hospitals from nondonor
                  hospitals were identified. We also compared the
                  number of donors and the number of donor hospitals
                  in 1992 and 1996. SETTING: United States. RESULTS:
                  Among all hospitals affiliated with the American
                  Hospital Association (n = 5607), 1214 (22\%) were
                  identified as donor hospitals (> or = 1 donation in
                  1992). Of 2333 hospitals with procurement
                  capability, 1268 (54\%) produced no donors in
                  1992. Based on a multiple logistic regression model,
                  donor hospitals differed from nondonor hospitals by
                  hospital ownership, with municipally owned hospitals
                  more likely and federally owned hospitals less
                  likely to produce donation, compared with for-profit
                  and not-for-profit hospitals. Other organizational
                  characteristics associated with donor hospitals were
                  level of trauma services, whether the hospital had a
                  transplant surgery program or a hospital ethics
                  committee, and whether it was located in the South
                  Atlantic, Southwest Central, or Pacific regions of
                  the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitals not
                  currently producing organ donations, there is a
                  sizable subgroup with donor potential. This area
                  merits further attention.}

  abstract =	 {CONTEXT: Transplantation has become the therapy of
                  choice for patients with organ failure. However, the
                  low rate of consent by families of donor-eligible
                  patients is a major limiting factor in the success
                  of organ transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To explore
                  factors associated with the decision to donate among
                  families of potential solid organ donors. DESIGN AND
                  SETTING: Data collection via chart reviews,
                  telephone interviews with health care practitioners
                  (HCPs) or organ procurement organization (OPO)
                  staff, and face-to-face interviews with family for
                  all donor-eligible deaths at 9 trauma hospitals in
                  southwestern Pennsylvania and northeastern Ohio from
                  1994 to 1999. PARTICIPANTS: Family members, HCPs,
                  and OPO staff involved in the donation decision for
                  420 donor-eligible patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
                  Factors associated with family decision to donate or
                  not donate organs for transplantation. RESULTS: A
                  total of 238 of the 420 cases led to organ donation;
                  182 did not. Univariate analysis revealed numerous
                  factors associated with the donation
                  decision. Multivariable analysis of associated
                  variables revealed that family and patient
                  sociodemographics (ethnicity, patient's age and
                  cause of death) and prior knowledge of the patients'
                  wishes were significantly associated with
                  willingness to donate (adjusted odds ratio [OR],
                  7.68; 95\% confidence interval [CI],
                  6.55-9.01). Families who discussed more topics and
                  had more conversations about organ donation were
                  more likely to donate (adjusted OR, 5.22; 95\% CI,
                  4.32-6.30), as were families with more contact with
                  OPO staff (adjusted OR, 3.08; 95\% CI, 2.63-3.60)
                  and those who experienced an optimal request pattern
                  (adjusted OR, 2.96; 95\% CI,
                  2.58-3.40). Socioemotional and communication
                  variables acted as intervening
                  variables. CONCLUSIONS: Public education is needed
                  to modify attitudes about organ donation prior to a
                  donation opportunity. Specific steps can be taken by
                  HCPs and OPO staff to maximize the opportunity to
                  persuade families to donate their relatives'
                  organs. },

                  majority of living kidney donors, but the reasons
                  behind the disparity in donation rates between men
                  and women remain obscure. We studied this issue by
                  gathering data on family members of living donor
                  allograft recipients at a single large center over a
                  5-year period (n = 144). By considering all
                  potential donors (spouses and first-degree
                  relatives) within each recipient's immediate family,
                  we determined that men and women are excluded as
                  donors at approximately similar rates on the basis
                  of medical condition or known blood group type A,
                  type B, type O incompatibility, and that a greater
                  percentage of acceptable female donors (28.3\%)
                  compared with men (20.3\%) go on to donate a kidney
                  (P: = 0.027). However, when only first-degree
                  relatives are considered, the difference in donation
                  rate between men and women becomes nonsignificant
                  (26.9\% of women versus 22.2\% of men; P =
                  0.229). Among spouses, the gender disparity in
                  donation rate is greater (36\% of wives versus 6.5\%
                  of husbands who are acceptable donors go on to
                  donate a kidney; P = 0.003). Evidence that economic
                  factors may contribute to the overall gender
                  disparity is also presented. In conclusion, the
                  gender disparity among living kidney donors observed
                  in our population can be largely attributed to an
                  overwhelming predominance of wives among spousal
                  donors. Possible explanations and potential
                  interventions to address underrepresentation of male
                  donors are discussed.},

                  a strategic response that I call differentiation,
                  and I locate the specific condition under which it
                  is implemented, the condition of competition. I
                  compare the strategic responses adopted by one
                  nonprofit, a large United Way, in two different
                  moments: a period of monopoly and a subsequent
                  period of competition. I show that nonprofits
                  differentiate themselves when facing a crowded
                  market. Differentiation occurs when nonprofits work
                  to convince other actors that they, rather than
                  their competitors, deserve resources. They seek to
                  assert uniqueness and superiority over their rivals
                  by constructing a hierarchical relationship between
                  themselves and others.}
