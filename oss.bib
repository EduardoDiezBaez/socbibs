		  of theories have emerged to explain its success, mainly
		  from economics and law. We analyze a very large sample of
		  \textsc{oss} projects and find striking patterns in the
		  overall structure of the development community. The
		  distribution of projects on a range of activity measures is
		  spectacularly skewed, with only a relatively tiny number of
		  projects showing evidence of the strong collaborative
		  activity which is supposed to characterize \textsc{oss}.
		  Our findings are consistent with prior, smaller-scale
		  empirical research. We argue that these findings pose
		  problems for the dominant accounts of \textsc{oss}. We
		  suggest that the gulf between active and inactive projects
		  may be explained by social-structural features of the
		  community which have received little attention in the
		  existing literature. We suggest some hypotheses that might
		  better predict the observed ecology of projects.}

		  on Sourceforge, I find a few surprising things. First, most

		  communities. The median number of developers in the 100
		  projects I looked at was 4 and the mode was 1 - numbers
		  much lower than previous numbers reported for highly
		  successful projects! Second, most OSS programs do not
		  generate a lot of discussion. Third, products with more
		  developers tend to be viewed and downloaded more often.
		  Fourth, the number of developers associated with a project
		  was positively correlated to the age of the project. Fifth,

		  operating system kernel was developed from three different
		  perspectives. Each focuses on different critical factors in
		  its success at the individual, group, and community levels.
		  The technical and management decisions of Linus Torvalds
		  the individual were critical in laying the groundwork for a
		  collaborative software development project that has lasted
		  almost a decade. The contributions of volunteer programmers
		  distributed worldwide enabled the development of an
		  operating system on the par with proprietary operating
		  systems. The Linux electronic community was the organizing
		  structure that coordinated the efforts of the individual
		  programmers. The paper concludes by summarizing the factors
		  important in the successful distributed development of the
		  Linux kernel, and the implications for organizationally
		  managed distributed work arrangements.}
