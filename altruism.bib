                  a strategic response that I call differentiation,
                  and I locate the specific condition under which it
                  is implemented, the condition of competition. I
                  compare the strategic responses adopted by one
                  nonprofit, a large United Way, in two different
                  moments: a period of monopoly and a subsequent
                  period of competition. I show that nonprofits
                  differentiate themselves when facing a crowded
                  market. Differentiation occurs when nonprofits work
                  to convince other actors that they, rather than
                  their competitors, deserve resources. They seek to
                  assert uniqueness and superiority over their rivals
                  by constructing a hierarchical relationship between
                  themselves and others.}
