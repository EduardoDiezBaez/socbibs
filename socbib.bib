	Volume = {37},
	Year = {2008},
	Abstract = {Sociologists often ask why particular groups of people have the moral views that they do. I argue that sociology's empirical research on morality relies, implicitly or explicitly, on unsophisticated and even obsolete ethical theories, and thus is based on inadequate conceptions of the ontology, epistemology, and semantics of morality. In this article I address the two main problems in the sociology of morality: (1) the problem of moral truth, and (2) the problem of value freedom. I identify two ideal--typical approaches. While the Weberian paradigm rejects the concept of moral truth, the Durkheimian paradigm accepts it. By contrast, I argue that sociology should be metaphysically agnostic, yet in practice it should proceed as though there were no moral truths. The Weberians claim that the sociology of morality can and should be value free; the Durkheimians claim that it cannot and it should not. My argument is that, while it is true that factual statements presuppose value judgments, it does not follow that sociologists are moral philosophers in disguise. Finally, I contend that in order for sociology to improve its understanding of morality, better conceptual, epistemological, and methodological foundations are needed.},

		  of ARPANET, created by the Defense Department's Advanced
		  Research Projects Agency, and its technological successors.
		  Abbate makes much of the military origins of the earliest
		  computer networks and of issues surrounding
		  packet-switching technology. She considers major
		  players--not just institutions but people like Paul Baran,
		  Robert Kahn, Vinton Cerf, Lawrence Roberts, and Donald
		  Davies--and pays special attention to the astonishing way
		  in which ARPANET eventually metamorphosed into an
		  egalitarian paradigm of commercial and civilian interaction
		  by the 1990s. Though the constant use of parenthetical
		  notation is distracting, and a much-needed glossary is
		  sadly omitted, this book is useful for anyone studying
		  information technology. Recommended for all public and
		  academic libraries.--Dayne Sherman, Southeastern Louisiana

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyze the
		  impact of the zonal allocation system for thoracic organs
		  on the outcome of our transplant activity. METHODS: We
		  analyzed the results of thoracic transplants performed
		  between 1987 and 1998. The transplants were divided into 3
		  groups: local donors retrieved by our team (171 hearts and
		  61 lungs; DL group); distant donors retrieved by our team
		  (58 hearts and 35 lungs; DD group); and distant donors
		  retrieved by other teams (51 hearts and 41 lungs; DX
		  group). RESULTS: No significant differences were observed
		  among the groups in early postoperative events for either
		  heart or lung transplantation. Heart transplants: Cardiac
		  index was 2.6 +/- 0.4 L/m(2) for the DL group, 2.7 +/- 0.6
		  L/m(2) for the DD group, and 2.5 +/- 0.7 L/m(2) for the DX
		  group (P =.4). The 30-day mortalities were 9.1\%, 9.1\%,
		  and 8.3\% ( P =.5) and the 1-year survivals 83\%, 80\%, and
		  82\% ( P =.4) for the DL, DD, and DX groups, respectively.
		  Lung transplants: Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was 358
		  +/- 19 mm Hg for the DL group, 345 +/- 17 mm Hg for the DD
		  group, and 329 +/- 21 mm Hg for the DX group (P =.07). The
		  30-day mortalities were 9.9\%, 10.5\%, and 12.8\% (P =.2)
		  and the 1-year survivals 79\%, 75\%, and 77\% (P =.3) for
		  the DL, DD, and DX groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Zonal
		  allocation for thoracic organs has been successfully
		  applied to our program. Using donor organs retrieved by
		  other teams, we have achieved equivalent outcomes for both
		  heart and lung transplantation.}}

		  assessing fair use claims face a difficult problem in
		  examining the fourth fair use factor the potential effect
		  of the infringing use upon the market for the copyrighted
		  work. A determination that the copyright holder's interest
		  has been harmed implicitly requires a finding that there is
		  a market for the use, and that the holder has a right to
		  prevent unpermitted uses. Often, the very existence of such
		  a market is at issue. In this context, a court's denial of
		  fair use may in effect award a new market to the copyright
		  holder to exploit. Although the determination of whether a
		  new market should belong to a copyright holder is integral
		  to preserving copyright's constitutionally mandated balance
		  between authors and the public, neither the fair use
		  statute nor Supreme Court precedent provides clear
		  standards. As a result, courts have had to strike out on
		  their own. This Comment argues that courts, overly
		  influenced by the market failure theory of fair use and
		  misled by licensing evidence, have failed to distinguish
		  between uses that should be paid for and uses that merely
		  can be paid for. Finally, this Comment suggests several
		  methods of reforming fair use analysis of the market effect
		  factor and concludes that, ultimately, Congress may be
		  better suited to presenting copyright's constitutional
		  balance than are the courts.}}

		  kinds of information that have no analogues in the physical
		  world. In some ways digital libraries and traditional
		  libraries are very different, yet in other ways they are

		  has to be organized, stored, and distributed, and they
		  still need to find and use information that others have
		  created. An underlying theme of this book is that no aspect
		  of digital libraries can be understood in isolation or
		  without attention to the needs of the people who create and
		  use information. Although the book covers a wide range of
		  technical, economic, social, and organizational topics, its

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shortage of liver donors means that new
		  methods of liver procurement must be explored. In domino
		  transplantation, organs explanted during transplantation in
		  one patient are transplanted into a second patient. Domino
		  procedures can be performed with livers from patients
		  having transplantation for hepatic metabolic disorders that
		  cause systemic disease without affecting other liver
		  functions. Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type I
		  is one of these. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the Paul Brousse
		  experience with a domino liver transplant program for FAP,
		  hoping to extend the approach to other metabolic disorders.
		  RESULTS: Livers from 10 patients transplanted for FAP type
		  1 were used for domino transplants to patients with
		  unresectable primary or metastatic liver cancers. There was
		  no perioperative mortality. Neuropathy or cardiomyopathy
		  did not increase the morbidity of the domino liver explant
		  and transplant procedures. Morbidity for the domino
		  recipients did not appear to be increased. Variant
		  transthyretin was detected in the serum in FAP liver
		  recipients, with no immediate clinical consequences.
		  CONCLUSIONS: The domino approach is feasible and requires
		  careful planning of the surgical procedures for liver
		  explantation, particularly for the nature and site of
		  vascular anastomoses. Domino transplantation of
		  metabolically dysfunctional livers creates new categories
		  of potential donors and potential recipients. It raises new
		  ethical, technical, and societal issues. The domino
		  approach could be used in several genetic or biochemical
		  disorders now treated by liver transplantation. It has the
		  potential to increase the number of liver grafts available
		  for transplantation.}}

		  gift economy proved that individuals could successfully
		  live together without needing either the state or the
		  market. From May 1968 to the late Nineties, this utopian
		  vision of anarcho-communism has inspired community media
		  and DIY culture activists. Within the universities, the
		  gift economy already was the primary method of socialising
		  labour. From its earliest days, the technical structure and
		  social mores of the Net has ignored intellectual property.
		  Although the system has expanded far beyond the university,
		  the self-interest of Net users perpetuates this hi-tech
		  gift economy. As an everyday activity, users circulate free
		  information as e-mail, on listservs, in newsgroups, within
		  on-line conferences and through Web sites. As shown by the
		  Apache and Linux programs, the hi-tech gift economy is even
		  at the forefront of software development. Contrary to the
		  purist vision of the New Left, anarcho-communism on the Net
		  can only exist in a compromised form. Money-commodity and
		  gift relations are not just in conflict with each other,
		  but also co-exist in symbiosis. The 'New Economy' of
		  cyberspace is an advanced form of social democracy.}}

	Abstract = {The increase in the private sector's collection and use of
		  individuals' personal information raises a new threat to
		  privacy in the electronic marketplace. Each day, businesses
		  are collecting sensitive information about consumers'
		  buying habits, occupations, income, families and product
		  preferences, This information is used to create customized
		  advertising campaigns, make decisions about which customers
		  to market products to and predict consumers' future
		  purchases. Current solutions to online privacy fail to give
		  consumers control over how their information is used or
		  compensation for the data they share. This comment will
		  propose that an on-line licensing system based on the
		  Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) can
		  achieve these objectives. Individuals will contract with
		  businesses for the right to use their personal information.
		  The licensing terms they negotiate will set limits on how
		  their data is used, how long it is used and what type of
		  benefit it is exchanged for.}}

		  in an innovating industry dares to fall behind the others
		  in new products and processes, and inter-firm collaboration
		  in the creation and use of innovations. While giving price
		  competition due credit, Baumol stresses that large firms
		  use innovation as a prime competitive weapon. However, as
		  he explains it, firms do not wish to risk too much
		  innovation, because it is costly, and can be made obsolete
		  by rival innovation. So firms have split the difference
		  through the sale of technology licenses and participation
		  in technology-sharing compacts that pay huge dividends to
		  the economy as a whole--and thereby make innovation a
		  routine feature of economic life. This process, in Baumol's
		  view, accounts for the unparalleled growth of modern
		  capitalist economies.}}

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Living related liver transplantation has been
		  developed as an important potential source of organs for
		  treatment of children with acute and chronic liver disease.
		  A single UK centre performing living related liver
		  transplantation was established in 1993. METHODS: Parents
		  who were potential donors for their children for living
		  related liver transplantation were assessed for suitability
		  according to a protocol based on one developed and
		  published by the University of Chicago Transplant Group.
		  Records kept by the transplant coordinators were retrieved
		  and data were extracted. RESULTS: Of 64 potential donors
		  for 32 potential recipients ten were excluded at a
		  preliminary stage. Fourteen ultimately became donors. Of 54
		  parents who began evaluation 23 were finally considered to
		  be suitable. There were 19 non-disease-related reasons for
		  unsuitability: blood group mismatch (eight cases), size
		  discrepancy (six), pregnancy (two), oral contraceptive
		  medication (one), vascular anatomy variant (one) and age
		  (one). Sixteen were unsuitable because disease was found,
		  namely fatty liver (four), thyroid disease (two), hepatitis
		  B positivity (two), cardiac murmur (one), anaemia (one),
		  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (one),
		  diabetes mellitus (one) and psychological problems (one),
		  and three parents were affected by the same disorder as the
		  child (Alagille syndrome, one; mitochondrial disorder, one;
		  recurrent cholestasis, one). Three parents were rejected
		  for more than one reason. Both parents were unsuitable for
		  donation in 21 per cent of cases. CONCLUSION: Parents
		  approach living related liver transplantation with
		  enthusiasm. They should be advised of the high chance of
		  unsuitability, including the finding of significant
		  pathology. The limitation of living related liver
		  transplantation as the major source of organs for children
		  is recognized.}}

		  related communication technologies is provided, with
		  attention to how, although the Internet seems worldwide, it
		  is limited to countries with preexisting structures like
		  telephone systems, and how the Internet is beginning to
		  merge with tv and telephone systems, despite starting out
		  separated from them. How the use of the Internet has
		  shifted from a business to a consumer context is also
		  addressed. It is held that modern technology may best be
		  understood in the form of a map and its trajectories (which
		  are presented), covering the historical distinctions of
		  technology, the sources of change, the outcome for
		  products, the character of change, and the underlying
		  trajectories of technology. The Internet's relationship
		  with the 'consumer ladder' is detailed, and it is argued
		  that the Internet has greatly expanded the number of people
		  who move up and down this ladder. 5 Grids. D. Weibel}}

		  Benkler argues that the enclosure movement poses a risk to

		  examines three laws at the center of this movement: the

	Abstract = {In the late 1990s, use of either of the words 'childhood'
		  or 'Internet' is enough to signify at a stroke many of
		  society's contemporary hopes and fears about what it means
		  to be modern. By providing a critical review of the
		  burgeoning (popular, policy, and-academic) literature that
		  is emerging as debates about 'childhood' and 'the Internet'
		  take centre stage in the ongoing struggle to define the
		  future of our 'virtual geographies: what we seek to do in
		  this paper is to unpack some of the assumptions that
		  underpin both terms. Specifically, we argue that there is
		  now a dominant story in circulation concerning what has
		  been called the rise of a 'digital generation: albeit one,
		  as we show, that can be read in two diametrically opposed
		  ways. In the central part of the paper, by characterising
		  the Internet as the latest in a long line of 'frontier'
		  technologies, we identify three senses (in terms of time,in
		  terms of space, and in terms of competence) in which this
		  dominant story acts to construct discursively the
		  cyberspace opened up by computer-mediated communication as
		  distinct from the 'here and now'. For all its
		  seductiveness, however, we propose that this discourse is
		  not adequate to describe the complexities of what
		  particular children might actually do with particular
		  Internet-based tools in particular settings. By drawing on
		  a variety of work (from both within and outside of the
		  discipline) which has begun to open up the undifferentiated
		  categories 'children' and 'technology' on which simplistic
		  notions of a cohort of 'cyberkids' are based, we conclude
		  the paper with some preliminary ideas about how we might be
		  able to offer more nuanced accounts of being connected.}}

		  Increasingly sophisticated attempts to provide access to
		  the rapidly growing quantity of available documents raised
		  questions about what should be considered a ``document.''
		  The answer is important for any definition of the scope of
		  information Science. Paul Otlet and others developed a
		  functional view of ``document'' and discussed whether, for
		  example, sculpture, museum objects, and live animals, could
		  be considered ``document.'' Suzanne Briet equated
		  ``document'' with organized physical evidence. These ideas
		  appear to resemble notions of ``material culture'' in
		  cultural anthropology and ``object-as-sign'' in semiotics,
		  Others, especially in the U.S.A. (e.g., Jesse Shera and
		  Louis Shores) took a narrower view. New digital technology

		  politics, drawing on a variety of secondary literature. The
		  notion that cyberspace is best understood in spatial terms
		  is criticized because it tends to privilege a single,
		  spatial ontology that unduly narrows the multitude of
		  potential configurations of digital domains. The essence of
		  computer networks is the fact that they enable instant
		  retrieval and processing of encoded signs, rather than
		  reproduce space. Cyberspace is understood as an
		  invocational domain in which data may be invoked through
		  simple commands. Thus, the ontology of the digital domain
		  is made up of the multiple ways in which addressability is
		  made possible. Drawing on the work of Martin Heidegger
		  (1977), it is argued that the significance of this
		  invocational ontology of the digital domain lies in the
		  fact that it requires rearrangement of the culture and
		  society around it. That which cannot be invoked in the
		  digital domain falls outside its purview. To the extent
		  that digital domains encroach on larger areas of social
		  life, aspects of society not encodable begin to drop out of
		  the ontology of the real world. 23 References. D. Ryfe}}

METHODS: Medical records were reviewed in a stratified random sample of 89 hospitals from 3 regions to attain a baseline of donor potential. Data on a range of hospital characteristics were collected and tested as predictors of donor potential through the use of hierarchical Poisson regression modeling. RESULTS: Five hospital characteristics predicted donor potential: hospital deaths, hospital Medicare case-mix index, total hospital staffed beds, medical school affiliation, and trauma center certification. Regional estimates were attained by aggregating individual hospital estimates. Confidence intervals for these regional estimates indicated that actual donations represented from 28\% to 44\% of the potential in the regions studied. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology accurately estimates organ donor potential within 3 geographic regions and lays the foundation for evaluating organ donation effectiveness nationwide. Additional research is needed to test the validity of the model in other geographic regions and to further explore organ donor potential in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds. },

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation is the treatment of
		  choice for patients with end-stage organ failure, but the
		  supply of organs has not increased to meet demand. This
		  study was undertaken to determine the potential for kidney
		  donation from patients with irremediable brain injuries who
		  do not meet the criteria for brain death and who experience
		  cardiopulmonary arrest after withdrawal of ventilatory
		  support (controlled non-heart-beating organ donors).
		  METHODS: The charts of 209 patients who died during 1995 in
		  the Emergency Department and the intensive care unit at the
		  Foothills Hospital in Calgary were reviewed. The records of
		  patients who met the criteria for controlled
		  non-heart-beating organ donation were studied in detail.
		  The main outcome measure was the time from discontinuation
		  of ventilation until cardiopulmonary arrest. RESULTS:
		  Seventeen potential controlled non-heart-beating organ
		  donors were identified. Their mean age was 62 (standard
		  deviation 19) years. Twelve of the patients (71\%) had had
		  a cerebrovascular accident, and more than half (10 [59\%])
		  did not meet the criteria for brain death because one or
		  more brain stem reflexes were present. At the time of
		  withdrawal of ventilatory support, the mean serum
		  creatinine level was 71 (29) mumol/L, mean urine output was
		  214 (178) mL/h, and 9 (53\%) patients were receiving
		  inotropic agents. The mean time from withdrawal of
		  ventilatory support to cardiac arrest was 2.3 (5.0) hours;
		  13 of the 17 patients died within 1 hour, and all but one
		  died within 6 hours. For the year for which charts were
		  reviewed, 33 potential conventional donors (people whose
		  hearts were beating) were identified, of whom 21 (64\%)
		  became donors. On the assumption that 40\% of the potential
		  controlled non-heart-beating donors would not in fact have
		  been donors (25\% because of family refusal and 15\%
		  because of nonviability of the organs), there might have
		  been 10 additional donors, which would have increased the
		  supply of cadaveric kidneys for transplantation by 48\%.
		  INTERPRETATION: A significant number of viable kidneys
		  could be retrieved and transplanted if eligibility for
		  kidney donation was extended to include controlled
		  non-heart-beating organ donors.}}

	Title = {The incidence and implications of renal cell carcinoma in cadaveric renal transplants at the time of organ recovery.},
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the exception of primary central nervous
		  system tumors, organ recovery is no longer considered from
		  donors with known malignancy. Because intrathoracic and
		  intraabdominal organs are usually recovered before the
		  kidneys, we examined the incidence of renal cell carcinoma
		  in cadaveric donor kidneys at the time of organ recovery.
		  This would establish the theoretical risk of transplanting
		  donor organs from a patient with a known renal malignancy.
		  METHODS: In cooperation with the Louisiana Organ
		  Procurement Agency, we reviewed the records of all patients
		  who were cadaveric kidney donors in the state of Louisiana
		  between September 1991 and October 1997. Information was
		  reviewed and analyzed on donor age, sex, race, past
		  medical/surgical history, cause of death, and the findings
		  at the time of organ recovery. RESULTS: A total of 553
		  consecutive cadaveric donors were identified, with 1106
		  kidneys recovered. Of the 553 cadaveric donors, 5 (0.9\%)
		  were noted to have an incidental renal cell carcinoma. All
		  tumors were identified in separate donors; that is, none of
		  the tumors were bilateral. None of the five donors had
		  documented symptoms referable to their urinary tract. All
		  tumors were either T1 or T2 by the tumor, node, metastasis
		  classification system, and no evidence of nodal or distant
		  metastatic disease was present. In one case, the
		  contralateral kidney, heart, and liver were transplanted
		  before the tumor was identified. In the remaining four
		  cases, all organs (renal and nonrenal) were discarded.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Renal cell carcinoma is rarely found during
		  renal recovery from a cadaveric donor. However, because the
		  kidneys are usually recovered after the intrathoracic and
		  intraabdominal organs, careful palpation of the kidneys and
		  exploration of any abnormalities is mandated to avoid
		  transplanting any organs from a donor with a known renal
		  malignancy.}}

		  as a product of 'containment culture' that has transferred

		  current widespread cultural uncertainty. Net sprawl has
		  also created demands for an authority to determine what is

		  could ultimately be destructive to democracy. Exploration
		  of the link between credibility and authority indicates
		  that cyberspace is a potential arena for political battles
		  over what is real involving both progressive causes and
		  those of subversive right-wing groups. However, it is

		  technical predictions in an accessible writing style, which
		  makes the weighty subject matter read more like a novel,
		  appealing to a nontechie audience. In addition, Dertouzos
		  sprinkles vignettes of the future throughout the text to
		  help readers envision technologies that have yet to be
		  introduced. Imagine using a personal network called a
		  'bodynet,' to talk on the phone, watch TV, read e-mail, and
		  take pictures from wherever you are. In our workplaces,
		  future innovations will increase productivity: Employees in
		  different locations will be able to do groupwork together
		  and order merchandise from around the world via e-forms.
		  Our governments will link to a world network to engage in
		  issues of diplomacy, trade, tourism, and more. For
		  newcomers, the book provides a brief history of the field
		  of information technology and explains the most current
		  advances in technology. What Will Be also unveils many
		  upcoming technologies in the Information Marketplace that
		  will transform our lives. Because the author is an expert
		  in information technology, he is naturally enthusiastic
		  about the inventions that new technology will bring. It is

		  has been proposed and used to shorten the waiting time of
		  kidney transplant candidates and to increase the graft
		  pool. Live donor renal transplants have demonstrated better
		  results in term of graft survival rates, compared to renal
		  transplants harvested from brain dead donor. Recently,
		  laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy has been introduced to
		  reduce the live procurement morbidity. This lower morbidity
		  may result in increased acceptance of the donor operation.
		  We initiated a program of laparoscopic live donor
		  nephrectomy in January 1997 and up until June 1998, three
		  cases were successfully performed in our department. The
		  purpose of this paper was to report the first case of this

	Title = {A new allocation plan for renal transplantation.},
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A novel plan of renal allograft allocation has
		  been conducted by United Network for Organ Sharing Region 1
		  transplant centers since September 3, 1996, based upon HLA
		  matching, time waiting, and population distance points. The
		  objectives of this plan were to achieve a balance between
		  increasing the opportunity of renal transplantation for
		  those patients listed with long waiting times and promoting
		  local organ donor availability. METHODS: A single list of
		  candidates was formulated for each cadaver donor, assigning
		  a maximum of 8 points for time waiting, a maximum of 8
		  points for population distance from the donor hospital, and
		  HLA points based upon the degree of B/DR mismatch.
		  Additional points were awarded to a cross-match-negative
		  patient with a panel-reactive antibody of \&gt;80\%, and to
		  pediatric patients. RESULTS: The total number of kidneys
		  transplanted to patients who had waited \&gt;3 years was
		  100 (46\%), and to patients who had waited \&gt;2.5-3 years
		  was 29 (13\%). However, the total number of kidneys
		  transplanted to patients with the maximum population
		  distance points was only 72 (33\%). Thus, although the plan
		  achieved a favorable distribution of kidneys to patients
		  with longer waiting times (nearly 60\%), the other, equally
		  important objective of promoting local donor availability
		  was not initially accomplished. Moreover, minor HLA B/DR
		  differences between the donor and the recipient (i.e., not
		  phenotypically matched) were unexpectedly consequential in
		  determining allocation. As a result of these observations,
		  the following adjustments were made in the plan (as of
		  December 3, 1997): a maximum of 10 points for population
		  distance, a maximum of 8 points for time waiting (both by a
		  linear correlation), and the retention of HLA points for 0
		  B/DR mismatch only. After these interval changes, the
		  percentage of patients receiving a kidney with some
		  population distance points increased from 85\% to 96\%.
		  Conclusions. We have shown that a heterogeneous region of
		  multiple transplant centers can devise (and modify) an
		  innovative and balanced plan that provides an equitable
		  system of allocation for an ever-increasing number of patients.}}

	Optannote = {A computerised register listing the names of people who have chosen not to donate organs or tissues after their death is being established in France. Anyone not on the register will be presumed to have consented to organ donation, although the family will still be able to object. Set up by the Etablissement Francais des Greffes, the government controlled transplant watchdog group, the list will enable hospitals to know immediately whether a clinically dead individual had chosen not to be a donor. Only one other European country, Portugal, keeps such a list, with 36000 people registered as non-donors. The registry is part of a campaign to encourage organ donations, which have decreased in recent years. In 1997, 320 patients died before a transplant could be attempted, and 5302 patients were on a waiting list. Yet polls have shown that nearly nine out of 10 people in France are in favour of organ donation, and no single factor has been identified to explain the decrease, which started in 1991 after a highly publicised incident of a boy's accidental death and the taking of his eyes without specific parental authorisation. The 1992 scandal about blood donations contaminated with HIV and more recent rumours that organs obtained illegally had been used for the benefit of wealthy foreign patients, may also have contributed to the increased number of refusals. In 1995, French general practitioners participated in a campaign to inform patients about organ donation and encourage them to donate organs after their death. The current campaign, and the setting up of the 'refusal list,' should hopefully help to increase the number of donors. Anyone aged over 13 years who is willing to donate organs after death is urged to inform his or her relatives and to carry a donor's card. The new law states that if a dead person does not have such a card, the principle of 'presumed consent' will hold, although this should be confirmed with the relatives.},

	Abstract = {Over the past two decades, an economic interpretation of
		  copyright law's fair-use doctrine has taken hold in court
		  decisions and academic discourse. This interpretation
		  posits that fair use exists in large part to counteract
		  economic imperfections that prevent smooth functioning of
		  the copyright marketplace. Recently, commentators focusing
		  on this type of analysis have predicted a drastically
		  reduced future for fair use in digital media such as the
		  Internet. The Clinton Administration's task force on
		  digital issues, adopting these commentators' logic, has
		  suggested that fair use may be unnecessary when an owner
		  can license uses. This conclusion rests on the idea that if
		  an owner can license the use, then the market is free of
		  imperfections, and thus fair use is unnecessary. The author
		  agrees that the Internet will markedly reduce many types of
		  market imperfections. The Internet grants owners the
		  ability to reach most users at very little cost. However,
		  the author argues that important sources of market
		  imperfection will continue to implicate the core values
		  that animate fair-use policy. At base, the copyright
		  framework must always serve to maximize the public benefit
		  from expressive works. In the face of lingering bargaining
		  casts, externalities, or anti-dissemination motives, the
		  new medium does nothing to ensure that the parties to a
		  given bargain will act with the public's best interest in
		  mind. The author focuses on one type of copying activity
		  central to everyday use of the internet: fragmented literal
		  copying of very small chunks of content The author
		  concludes that, notwithstanding copyright owners'
		  ostensible ability to license these uses cheaply, fair use
		  remains an essential tool to allow fragmented uses that
		  will further copyright's major policy goals.}}

		  the constructs of radical change in order to employ an
		  appropriate holistic context for examination; (2)
		  children's increasing freedom from the dominance of a

		  transplantation is increasing despite the concern whether
		  all the donors are dead. This concern is based on the
		  adequacy of documentation of death and the appropriate
		  duration that circulation and respiration should be absent
		  before death certification. No studies have examined the
		  documentation and deaths of patients who became
		  non-heart-beating organ donors. DESIGN: Retrospective study
		  of observational data. PATIENTS: All non-brain-dead
		  patients who became non-heart-beating organ donors at the
		  University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from January 1,
		  1993, to June 30, 1998, were identified. Records for 15 of
		  16 patients were available for review. MEASUREMENTS AND
		  MAIN RESULTS: Adequacy of documentation, extubation time,
		  onset of severe hypotension, duration of absent circulation
		  before death was certified, and the time of incision for
		  organ procurement were ascertained. Twelve of 15 records
		  had all required clinical documentation. The mean age of
		  patients was 46.5 +/- 5.7 yrs. All 15 patients were
		  extubated before death and had femoral arterial catheters;
		  one had a biventricular assist device discontinued. The
		  time of hypotension and pulselessness was not documented
		  for one and three patients, respectively. All 12 patients
		  with documentation had \&gt; or =2 mins of absent
		  circulation. Time from certification to incision for
		  procurement was 1.1 +/- 2.3 mins. CONCLUSIONS: In a small
		  study of non-heart-beating organ donation, circulation
		  never resumed after \&gt;1 min of absent circulation,
		  suggesting that 2 mins of absent circulation is sufficient
		  to certify death. Three of 15 patients had inadequate
		  documentation. Gaps and inconsistencies in documentation
		  may raise concern about the potential for abuse.}}

		  although patients in both groups are not dead by current
		  legal standards. Performance on items relating to so-called
		  non-heart-beating organ donation suggested that 75\% of the
		  group do not support non-heart-beating organ donation
		  without assurance that the donors are brain-dead before
		  procurement begins. Given that current recommendations to
		  increase organ donation look to non-heart-beating organ
		  donation rather than to anencephalic patients and those in
		  a persistent vegetative state, these findings suggest that
		  further ethical discussion and analysis are urgently needed.}}

	Abstract = {CFC numbers have shown to correlate with success of
		  engraftment and speed of neutrophil recovery following cord
		  blood (CB) transplantation. To investigate whether the
		  number of Meg-CFC in a CB stem cell preparation might
		  correlate with time to platelet engraftment, we evaluated
		  the frequency of Meg-CFC among all CFC types in 134 CB, 21
		  adult bone marrow (BM) and 52 cytokine-mobilized peripheral
		  blood (PB) stem cell preparations. The correlation of
		  Meg-CFC with the total number of CFC and mixed cell-CFC was
		  also assessed. The frequency of Meg-CFC was highest in CB
		  and correlated significantly with total CFC numbers (mean
		  20.8\%, correlation coefficient (r) 0.84, P = 0.0001)
		  compared with Meg-CFC from mobilized PB (mean 13.1\%, r =
		  0.29, P = 0.07) and BM (mean 4\%, r = 0. 39, P = 0.13). In
		  addition, mixed-cell CFC numbers in CB were highly
		  correlated with the total number of Meg-CFC (r = 0.7, P =
		  0.0001). No such correlations were found with mobilized PB
		  or BM. We conclude that, based on the high degree of
		  correlation between Meg-CFC and non-Meg-CFC numbers in CB,
		  no additional information concerning time to platelet
		  engraftment would be gained by routinely performing Meg-CFC
		  assays in addition to non-Meg-CFC assays. The fact that CB
		  Meg-CFC and mixed-cell CFC are strongly correlated suggests
		  that CB Meg-CFC are more primitive than their counterparts
		  in BM and PB and may reflect the number of stem cells in
		  CB. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2000).}}

		  did. The primary determinant of usage was whether a student
		  owned a computer. However, even in this case, African
		  Americans who did not own a computer used computers more
		  often than whites who were similarly situated. Thus, recent
		  commentary suggesting that a racial divide exists in
		  computer usage, caused by gaps in income levels, is
		  rejected. Instead, it is argued that, if African Americans
		  use computers less often than whites in the general
		  population, this may be due to a lack of trust among
		  African Americans toward an invasive new technology. 1

		  expanding the scope and target of digital libraries by
		  focusing on a greater source of technical publications and
		  using 'buckets,' an object- oriented construct for grouping
		  logically related information objects, to include holdings

	Optnote = {OBJECTIVES--To estimate the potential supply of organ donors and to measure the efficiency of organ procurement efforts in the United States. METHODS--A geographic database has been developed consisting of multiple cause of death and sociodemographic data compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics. All deaths are evaluated as to their potential for organ donation. Two classes of potential donors are identified: class 1 estimates are restricted to causes of death involving significant head trauma only, and class 2 estimates include class 1 estimates as well as deaths in which brain death was less probable. RESULTS--Over 23,000 people are currently awaiting a kidney, heart, liver, heart-lung, pancreas, or lung transplantation. Donor supply is inadequate, and the number of donors remained unchanged at approximately 4000 annually for 1986 through 1989, with a modest 9.1\% increase in 1990. Between 6900 and 10,700 potential donors are available annually (eg, 28.5 to 43.7 per million population). Depending on the class of donor considered, organ procurement efforts are between 37\% and 59\% efficient. Efficiency greatly varies by state and organ procurement organization. CONCLUSIONS--Many more organ donors are available than are being accessed through existing organ procurement efforts. Realistically, it may be possible to increase by 80\% the number of donors available in the United States (up to 7300 annually). It is conceivable, although unlikely, that the supply of donor organs could achieve a level to meet demand. },

	Abstract = {Argues that, to understand the legitimacy of a culture,
		  its relation to the archives, ie, the site for the
		  accumulation of records, must be investigated. Archive
		  reason is concerned with the particularity and singularity
		  of the event. Increasingly, the focus has shifted from
		  archiving the lives of the good and the great to recording
		  the details of mundane everyday life. The problem then
		  becomes not what to put into the archives but what to leave
		  out. Some of the implications of these questions were
		  considered by Georg Simmel in his argument that there has
		  been a buildup and overload in the production and
		  circulation of objective culture that has exceeded the
		  individual's subjective capacity to assimilate and order.
		  In this way, the individual is confronted with irresolvable
		  dilemmas over selectivity, with each particular choice
		  amounting to a wager that inevitably closes off others.
		  Related questions about the difficulties of handling
		  cultural completeness were also addressed by Borges. Yet
		  neither thinker could have anticipated the full
		  implications of the electronic archive: the development of
		  new technologies for storing, searching, and communicating
		  information through the Internet via databases and
		  hypertext links. The electronic archive offers new
		  possibilities for speed, mobility, and completeness of
		  access to cultures that have become digitalized, raising
		  fundamental questions about ownership, intellectual
		  property rights, censorship, and democratic access. It is
		  contended that the new electronic archives will change not
		  only the form in which culture is produced and recorded,
		  but also the wider conditions under which it is enacted and
		  lived.}}

		  bacteremic is controversial. We examined the outcome of
		  recipients of solid organs from donors with bacteremia
		  and/or fungemia at the time of organ recovery. METHODS: All
		  organ donors from a single organ procurement organization
		  between January 1990 and December 1996 were retrospectively
		  analyzed. We calculated rates of transmission from
		  bacteremic or fungemic donors to their recipients and
		  compared the graft and patient survival rates for
		  recipients of these organs with those for recipients of
		  organs from non-bacteremic donors. RESULTS: There were 95
		  (5.1\%) bacteremic donors from a total of 1775, from whom
		  212 recipients received organs. Forty-six (48\%) of the
		  bacteremic donors had pathogens in their blood. Among the
		  101 recipients of organs from these, no evidence of
		  transmission could be documented. (0\% transmission rate,
		  95\% CI 0-3). The remaining 49 donors had either
		  Staphylococcus epidermidis or other unlikely pathogens
		  recovered from the blood. Examination of the 111 recipients
		  of organs from these donors also found no evidence for
		  transmission (0\% transmission rate, 95\% CI 0-3). Of the
		  212 recipients, 193 (91\%) received a mean of 3.8+/-2.5
		  days of antibiotics postoperatively. The 30-day graft and
		  patient survival for recipients of organs from bacteremic
		  donors was not significantly different from recipients of
		  organs from nonbacteremic donors (P = 0.695 for patient
		  survival, and P = 0.310 for graft survival). CONCLUSIONS:
		  Organs transplanted from bacteremic donors do not transmit
		  bacterial infection or result in poorer outcomes. Use of
		  organs from these donors could help increase organ availability.}}

		  economic growth'' and that a new ``creative class'' has
		  become the dominat class in American society. The creative
		  economy is defined broadly (echoing Howkins's approach),
		  and so the creative class is a disparate selection of
		  occupations. Because most members of this class don't see
		  themselves as part of it, a good portion of the book argues
		  that its members need to develop their class consciousness.
		  The main mechanism for this is the tendency of creative
		  people of different sorts to move to cities with particular
		  characteristics, particularly ``technology, talent and
		  tolerance.'' Cities that score highly on an idex of these
		  characteristics (like Boston, San Francisco and Austin) are
		  the places most likely to see a real ``creative community''
		  grow with many promised economic and social benefits. }}

		  governments and businesses threatens to make informational
		  privacy obsolete. The first part of this article describes
		  a range of current technologies to which the law has yet to
		  respond effectively. These include: routine collection of
		  transactional data, growing automated surveillance in
		  public places, deployment of facial recognition technology
		  and other biometrics, cell-phone tracking, vehicle
		  tracking, satellite monitoring, workplace surveillance,
		  Internet tracking from cookies to 'clicktrails,'
		  hardware-based identifiers, intellectual
		  property-protecting 'switchware,' and sense- enhanced
		  searches that allow observers to see through everything
		  from walls to clothes. The cumulative and reinforcing
		  effect of these technologies may make modern life
		  completely visible and permeable to observers; there could
		  be nowhere to hide. The second part of this article
		  discusses leading attempts to craft legal responses to the
		  assault on privacy-including self-regulation,
		  privacy-enhancing technologies, data-protection law, and
		  property-rights based solutions-in the context of three
		  structural obstacles to privacy enhancement: consumers'
		  privacy myopia; important First Amendment protection of
		  rights to collect and repeat information; and fear of what
		  other people may do if not monitored. The article concludes
		  that despite the warnings of information privacy
		  pessimists, all is not lost-yet.}}

	Abstract = {Over the past two decades, as the presence of digital
		  technology has become more and more ubiquitous, its
		  tremendous capabilities of reproduction and distribution
		  have created difficult issues for copyright law. Recently,
		  Congress has addressed some of these issues by taking the
		  nontraditional approach of directly regulating the
		  manufacture, development, and distribution of technology.
		  In 1992, Congress enacted the Audio Home Recording Act,
		  requiring that all digital audio recording devices possess
		  a serial copy management system to limit the copying of
		  digital music recordings. Six years later, Congress passed
		  the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, making it a crime to
		  manufacture or distribute technologies for the purpose of
		  circumventing technological measures taken by copyright
		  owners to protect their copyrights. This Comment examines
		  copyright regulation of technology by analyzing the
		  relative merits of these two statutes vis-a-vis the broader
		  goals of copyright law. It concludes that copyright
		  statutes can best regulate technology if they designate a
		  specific copyright protection system, require technology
		  manufacturers to incorporate the protection system into
		  their products, and identify a rulemaking body to maintain
		  the statutes' effectiveness.}}

		  Corneal buttons were obtained from 7 keratoconus patients
		  and stored in a preserving solution for 7-60 days (average,
		  32.4 days) before use. The recipient eyes comprised
		  recurrent pterygium 3 eyes, primary pterygium 1 eye,
		  pseudopterygium 1 eye, corneal perforation with iris
		  prolapse due to fungal corneal ulcer 1 eye, and limbal
		  dermoid 1 eye. RESULTS: The recipient eyes ran favorable
		  courses in general. Graft rejection developed in 2 eyes and
		  was successfully treated with topical and systemic
		  corticosteroid. CONCLUSIONS: Preserved corneas from
		  keratoconus eyes were found useful in therapeutic lamellar
		  keratoplasty. By this procedure, the current inadequate
		  supply of donor corneas in eye banks in Japan can be
		  augmented.}}

		  technologies such as trusted systems will enable copyright
		  owners to exercise an unprecedented degree of control over
		  their intangible property. Technological methods of
		  intellectual property protection are so powerful that they

In any institution characterized by a strong belief system, authority relationships may be threatened to the degree that cynical knowledge is acquired by participants early in their careers.

	Abstract = {Jeremy Bentham's (1791) panopticon has, courtesy of Michel
		  Foucault (1975), become a dominant metaphor in surveillance
		  studies. This central eye, aimed at the moral reform of
		  institutionalized bodies and operating through a de facto
		  closure of individual agency, tends to limit the conception
		  of the complex ways surveillance serves and disrupts power.
		  Via analysis of commercial and workplace surveillance, it
		  is shown here that power is contested, and agency is never
		  completely closed down. To comprehend this negotiated
		  relationship, an alternative framework - plague management
		  - is presented. This envisions surveillance in a social
		  setting operated by multiple agents who themselves are open
		  to the gaze of those surveyed. The aim of this project is
		  to categorize rather than to reform and cure, and,
		  moreover, space is available for resistance. On the global
		  scale, new technologies have opened space for informal,
		  local surveillances to be effectively linked to media and
		  Internet audiences. These surveillance networks, informal
		  alliances of a variety of actors, have the potential to
		  radically alter orthodox relations of power by evading the
		  information controls of the state and connecting a local
		  gaze with the global community. It is concluded that,
		  although surveillance studies has rightly been concerned
		  with the control capacities of information technology, a
		  balance must be actively sought with the facilitative,
		  enabling, and even democratic impulses nascent in the new
		  technology.}}

A retrospective review of financial and medical records of potential organ donors was done at an urban level 1 trauma center. Total hospital stay (T1+T2) for the group was broken down into the interval between admission and diagnosis of lethality (T1) and between diagnosis of lethality and death (T2). Medical complications occurring during the hospital stay and charges generated during each time interval were abstracted. After consent was obtained, 19 of 53 (36 percent) potential donors failed to donate: 9 of 19 (47 percent) expired prior to legal determination of brain death; 10 patients failed to progress to brain death and were made DNR. Of these, 9 died within 24 hr, 1 survived 16 days; 6 of the 10 patients did not meet brain death criteria, and 4 were rejected by the OPO for reasons of infectious risks. There were 3.1+/-1.3 medical complications per patient. T1 was less than 4 hr in 16/19 (84 percent) potential donors and constituted a small percentage of the mean total hospital stay (37+/-10 hr). Charges generated during T1+T2 (33,997+/-25,843) and specifically during T2 (17,385+/-9453) were considerable. These charges were passed on to patients' families or third party payers though care was directed solely at organ procurement after diagnosis of lethality. We conclude that multiple medical complications are encountered in the care of potential organ donors; total hospital stays are short but expensive; more than 50 percent of charges generated during the total hospital stay arise from care provided after determination of lethality; and the goodwill of families to consent to organ donations of their loved ones appears to carry potential for significant financial burden.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The preparation, banking
		  and distribution of cryopreserved heart valves has been
		  carried out at the European Homograft Bank (EHB) in
		  Brussels without interruption since January 1989. We
		  present an assessment of the Bank's activities during this
		  10-year period. METHODS: Heart valve donors aged \&lt;62
		  years form three categories: multiorgan donors with
		  non-transplantable hearts; recipients of cardiac
		  transplantation; and non-beating heart cadavers with a warm
		  ischemia time of less than 6 h. Past history and biology
		  are checked for transmissible diseases. Dissection,
		  incubation in antibiotics and cryopreservation in 10\%
		  dimethylsulfoxide with storage in liquid nitrogen vapors
		  (about -150 degrees C), and quality control are according
		  to the standards of the Belgian Ministry of Health.
		  Cryopreserved valves are shipped to the implantation
		  centers in a dry shipper at about -150 degrees C. RESULTS:
		  Between January 30th 1989 and December 31st 1998, 1,817
		  non-transplantable hearts and 12 excised semilunar valves
		  were obtained. In total, 2,077 valves (1,032 pulmonary, 931
		  aortic and 13 mitral) were decontaminated, cryopreserved
		  and stored in liquid nitrogen vapor (six more valves were
		  refrigerated). In total, 1,515 valves were discarded at
		  different stages of the protocol, the main causes of
		  rejection being significant macroscopic lesions (68.2\%
		  aortic and 26.67\% pulmonary). Inadequate excision at
		  procurement (10.37\% pulmonary), persistent contamination
		  after antibiotics (5.6\%) and positive serology for
		  hepatitis B and C and Q fever (5.4\%) were other frequent
		  causes for rejection. Among the 2,117 accepted valves,
		  1,398 were graded first and 719 second choice, mainly on
		  the basis of morphology. In total, 2,090 cryopreserved
		  valves and one refrigerated valve were implanted in 39
		  institutions between May 1989 and December 1998. Of
		  requests, 10.02\% could not be satisfied. In total, 967
		  pulmonary valves were implanted in the right ventricular
		  outflow tract (RVOT); 424 during a Ross procedure, and 76
		  in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Of the aortic
		  valves, 732 were implanted in the LVOT and 266 in the RVOT.
		  Mitral homografts were used for tricuspid valve replacement
		  in two cases, and in the mitral position in seven.
		  Complications at distribution and thawing included 10 bag
		  ruptures and 16 transversal conduit wall fractures. Of the
		  valves shipped, 317 (13.16\%) were not used and were
		  returned safely in the dry shipper. Comparison of
		  distribution rates in the first 5.5 and last 4.5 years of
		  EHB activity shows: (i) a significant increase in pulmonary
		  valve implantations in the RVOT (from 71.95\% to 81.95\%);
		  and (ii) a marked increase (265\%) in pulmonary homograft
		  implantations as part of a Ross operation, and a
		  significant decrease (28\%) in aortic homograft
		  implantation in the LVOT. CONCLUSION: While macroscopic
		  lesions of procured aortic valves remain the most frequent
		  and unavoidable cause of homograft rejection during quality
		  control, the high percentage of inadequate surgical heart
		  valve excision should be corrected. The rates of bacterial
		  contamination and positive serology seem acceptable.
		  Storage and shipping of cryopreserved homografts in liquid
		  nitrogen vapor permits them to be spared very efficiently.
		  The increasing use of pulmonary valves for RVOT
		  reconstruction either in congenital heart disease or as
		  part of the Ross procedure compensates for the limited
		  availability of good quality aortic valves.}}

	Abstract = {The number of patients awaiting lung transplantation (LT)
		  and waiting time for surgery is increasing. In Australia,
		  LT rates are 4. 6/million population/yr, which despite low
		  organ donation rates, are the highest published in the
		  world. The Australian organ allocation system allows
		  identification of marginal donors and therapeutic
		  manipulation where appropriate. This study aims to assess
		  the impact of utilization of marginal donors and aggressive
		  donor management. A comparison between published donor
		  criteria and local practice is made, allowing assessment of
		  the effect of using marginal donors on outcome. Donor
		  management included antibiotic therapy, strict fluid
		  management, physiotherapy, bronchoscopy and bronchial
		  toilet, and alteration of ventilatory settings including
		  initiation of pressure support. Blood gases were repeated
		  to assess the results of interventions. Between January 1,
		  1995 and May 31, 1998, we performed 140 transplants from
		  112 of 219 (51\%) lung donor offers. Of these donors, 48
		  (43\%) satisfied all published criteria for suitable donor
		  organs (Group 1 = ideal donors) and 64 (57\%) did not
		  (Group 2 = marginal donors). Criteria breached by the
		  marginal donors were: an initial ratio of arterial oxygen
		  pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) \&lt;
		  300 mm Hg (n = 20), abnormal radiology (n = 39), pulmonary
		  infection (n = 24), 20 pack-years smoking (n = 5) and age
		  \&gt; 55 yr (n = 4). Therapeutic manipulation resulted in
		  improvement in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio in 20 donors (Group 3)
		  who would not otherwise have been used. Immediate and 24 h
		  postoperative gas exchange and length of intensive care
		  unit (ICU) stay was not different for recipients from
		  donors from all three groups. Overall survival was 94\% at
		  30 d, 83\% at 1 yr, 70\% at 2 yr, and 62\% at 3 yr and was
		  not significantly different from the three groups. We
		  conclude that organ utilization can be maximized by
		  therapeutic manipulation and utilization of marginal donors
		  without compromising results from transplantation.}}

		  (Microsoft) fantasticaly successful in their respective
		  fields. Until recently, intellectual property existed
		  primarily in the form of books, newspapers, magazines,

		  now moving from a print and analog-based format to digital,
		  many of the same concerns remain. Owners of new forms of

		  text, images, animation, audio and film clips on the

	Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to study current policies
		  and practices of scholarly journals on evaluating
		  manuscripts for publication that had been previously
		  published electronically. Various electronic forms were
		  considered: a manuscript having been e-mailed to members of
		  a listserv, attached to a personal or institutional home
		  page, stored in an electronic preprint collection, or
		  published in an electronic proceedings or electronic
		  journal. Factors that might affect the consideration of
		  such manuscripts were also examined, including
		  characteristics of the journal, the previously published
		  work, and the submitted manuscript. A sample of 202
		  scholarly journals in the sciences, social sciences, and
		  arts and humanities was selected for study. A questionnaire
		  and cover letters were sent to the journal editors in the
		  summer and fall of 1997, with an overall return rate of
		  57.4\%. Results are reported for all journals, with
		  comparisons being made between journals edited in the
		  Unites States and outside the Unites States, by journal
		  impact factor, and by discipline. The findings suggest that
		  editorial policies regarding prior electronic publication
		  are in an early stage of development. Most journal editors
		  do not have a formal policy regarding the evaluation of
		  work previously published in electronic form, nor are they
		  currently evaluating such a policy. Editors disagreed
		  widely on the importance of the various factors that might
		  affect their decision to consider a work previously
		  published electronically. The form or type of prior
		  electronic publication was an important variable. Although
		  some editors currently have a fairly rigid and negative
		  posture towards work previously published electronically,
		  most are willing to consider certain forms of such work for
		  publication in their journals. Probably the most
		  significant results of the study were the many differences
		  in practices among scholarly disciplines. The findings of
		  this study reveal how the internet and the World Wide Web
		  are currently affecting manuscript consideration policies
		  of scholarly journals at this early stage of Web and
		  Internet publishing.}}

		  compared, and the impact of the Internet is examined in
		  terms of adjustments that a TV-dominated culture must make
		  in a society that includes Internet communications. The
		  investigation finds that the Internet will modify tv
		  communications by (1) reducing the anonymity of people and
		  their communications, (2) increasing the storage of and
		  access to information, and (3) affording any individual the
		  possibility of controlling the recovery and dissemination
		  of communications. The Internet expands individual freedom
		  and capability to communicate, which results in greater
		  news gathering and interpretive communication among the
		  masses. Because the Internet is substantially different
		  from tv, its influence will be massive. Increased
		  specialization, fragmentation, individualization, and
		  decentralization of societal activity will cause stress to
		  social, economic, and political institutions. Eventually,
		  society will adjust to the new communications culture, but
		  it will be a substantially different society from one
		  dominated by tv. 40 References. Adapted from the source

		  slice of contemporary cultural history has a whiff of
		  paradox about it: what can it mean, exactly, to say that we
		  humans have become something other than human? The answer,
		  Katherine Hayles explains, lies not in ourselves but in our
		  tools. Ever since the invention of electronic computers
		  five decades ago, these powerful new machines have inspired
		  a shift in how we define ourselves both as individuals and
		  as a species. Hayles tracks this shift across the history
		  of avant-garde computer theory, starting with Norbert
		  Weiner and other early ``cyberneticists,'' who were the
		  first to systematically explore the similarities between
		  living and computing systems. Hayles's study ends with
		  artificial-life specialists, many of whom no longer even
		  bother to distinguish between life forms and computers.
		  Along the way she shows these thinkers struggling to
		  reconcile their traditional, Western notions of human
		  identity with the unsettling, cyborg directions in which
		  their own work seems to be leading humanity. This is more
		  than just the story of a geek elite, however. Hayles looks
		  at cybernetically inspired science fiction by the likes of
		  Philip K. Dick, William Gibson, and Neal Stephenson to show
		  how the larger culture grapples with the same issues that
		  dog the technologists. She also draws lucidly on her own
		  broad grasp of contemporary philosophy both to
		  contextualize those issues and to contend with them
		  herself. The result is a fascinating introduction--and a
		  valuable addition--to one of the most important currents in
		  recent intellectual history. (AZ, Julian Dibbell)}}

		  to. Heartfield argues that truly creative jobs are a small
		  portion of the overall workforce, which is increasingly
		  service oriented. He notes, for instance, that Britain had
		  four times as many domestic service workers in 1999 than in
		  1861, and eight times as many as in 1930. He attributes the
		  popularity of the ``creative economy'' label to the fact
		  that the Goverment is understandably ``unwilling to promote

		  contribute only marginally to each country's economy.
		  Although there is a sizeable information technology (it)

		  connected to the Internet. (2) The information revolution
		  is largely concentrated in the g-7 countries: only 5 of
		  them account for 80\% of the it market. (3) Analysis of the
		  Internet reveals that it is overwhelmingly US-based,
		  English-speaking, and Western-focused. Thus, the
		  information revolution could presage the rapid and
		  widespread transmission of information in a culture-laden,
		  asymmetrical way. A call is made for international dialogue

		  rates of individual hospitals. DESIGN: Data from hospital
		  databases were retrospectively reviewed for patient
		  separation ICD-9-CM codes (i.e., diagnostic codes from the
		  International classification of diseases, 9th revision,
		  clinical modification) to identify and categories actual
		  and potential organ donors. Organ donor indices for groups
		  of codes and for individual hospitals were determined by
		  dividing the number of actual donors by the total number of
		  patients who died with the same separation ICD-9-CM codes.
		  SETTING: The three South Australian adult tertiary
		  hospitals in 1988-1995. PATIENTS: The 154 actual organ
		  donors, and all patients aged less than 71 years who died
		  with the same groups of ICD-9-CM codes as the organ donors.
		  RESULTS: Organ donors could be classified by three groups
		  of ICD-9-CM codes specifying diseases or pathological
		  processes that could result in brain death. These groups
		  were head injury (44.2\% of donors), cerebrovascular
		  accident (CVA) (42.2\%), and eight \&quot;other\&quot;
		  codes (13.6\%). Differences between the head injury donor
		  indices for the three hospitals were not significant
		  (Hospital A, 19.1\%; Hospital B, 24\%; Hospital C, 21\%),
		  but there were significant interhospital differences in
		  donor indices for the CVA group (A, 11.2\%; B, 5.7\%; C,
		  5.1\%; P \&lt; 0.05) and the \&quot;other\&quot; group (A,
		  3.6\%; B, 0.7\%; C, 0.3\%; P \&lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
		  ICD-9-CM codes can be used to describe organ donors and
		  hospital populations from which potential organ donors may
		  be found. The casemix-controlled organ donor indices can be
		  used to compare the organ donor rates of individual
		  hospitals and to examine reasons for low rates (other than
		  purely casemix variation).}}

		  commercial development of the World Wide Web is the current
		  lack of consumer trust in this new commercial medium. This
		  lack of trust is engendered primarily by the industry's
		  documented failure to respond satisfactorily to mounting
		  consumer concerns over information privacy in electronic,
		  networked environments. How such concerns are affecting the
		  growth and development of consumer-oriented commercial
		  activity on the Web is examined, along with implications
		  for potential industry response. In the short run, the
		  commercial development of the Web depends on giving
		  consumers the opportunity to be anonymous when engaging in
		  information exchanges and online transactions. Ultimately,
		  however, commercial Web providers must come to realize that
		  the Internet dramatically shifts the balance of power
		  between a business and its customers, and therefore,
		  radical new business strategies will be required for
		  long-term success. Because the Web offers unprecedented
		  opportunities for interacting with customers, strategies
		  that take advantage of the medium's unique features are
		  likely to reap important rewards in customer satisfaction,
		  loyalty, and retention. Therefore, in the long run, the
		  most effective way for commercial Web providers to develop
		  profitable exchange relationships with online customers is
		  to gain consumer trust by allowing the balance of power to
		  shift toward more cooperative interactions.}}

		  experience'' delivered in the mosaiclike world of

	Title = {Outcomes in patients who are hepatitis {B} surface antigen-positive before transplantation: an analysis and study using the joint {ISHLT}/{UNOS} thoracic registry.},
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B surface antigenemia (HBsAg) has
		  been considered at least a relative contraindication for
		  heart transplantation, yet patients have undergone liver
		  transplantation for hepatitis B-induced chronic liver
		  disease, albeit with poorer results than for other liver
		  diseases. The impact of asymptomatic hepatitis B infection
		  on heart transplant outcome is not known. METHODS: To
		  examine this question, we queried the Joint International
		  Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation/United Network
		  of Organ Sharing Thoracic Registry for all patients
		  undergoing heart transplantation who had been identified as
		  positive for HBsAg before transplantation. We then sent a
		  4-question data instrument to the centers responsible for
		  the identified patients. Seventy-eight patients were
		  identified. Of the 78 data forms sent, 53 forms were
		  returned with the requested data. Of the 53 data forms
		  returned, the centers incorrectly identified 23 patients as
		  positive for HBsAg, resulting in 30 patients who were
		  confirmed as HBsAg positive and who served as the final
		  cohort for this analysis. RESULTS: The cohort included 24
		  males and 6 females, with a mean age of 46 +/- 16 years
		  (range 0 to 68 years). Eleven patients had coronary artery
		  disease, 14 had dilated cardiomyopathy, and 5 patients had
		  a variety of other cardiac diseases. Of those tested at
		  most recent follow-up, 20 of 25 patients continued to be
		  positive for HBsAg, whereas 7 of 21 patients studied had
		  converted and were hepatitis B serum antibody-positive.
		  Approximately 37\% of the patients had evidence of active
		  hepatic inflammation or cirrhosis. We found a statistically

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze factors influencing the surgical
		  success of penetrating keratoplasty and long-term graft
		  survival when using imported donor corneas. METHODS:
		  Sixty-three donor corneas imported to Taipei from the
		  Cincinnati Eye Bank from July 1992-June 1993 were used for
		  penetrating keratoplasty. The corneal endothelium was
		  examined using specular microscopy on arrival in Taiwan.
		  The endothelial morphology and endothelial cell density
		  (ECD) were compared with the photograph of the same cornea
		  taken in the United States. The relationships of the
		  surgical success rate with donor age, death to enucleation
		  time, death to surgery time, and ECD were analyzed. The
		  long-term graft survival and ECD of clear grafts were
		  analyzed 4 years after surgery. RESULTS: On specular
		  microscopic examination. the imported corneas showed
		  diminished endothelial reflection, blurred cellular
		  borders, and increased dark areas, which were markedly
		  different from the pictures of the corneal endothelium
		  taken in the United States. The average ECD before
		  transportation was 2,525+/-267/mm2 and decreased to
		  1,934+/-250/mm2 after transportation (p \&lt; 0.001), with
		  an average endothelial cell loss of 590+/-247/mm2. The
		  overall surgical success rate was 89\% and did not
		  correlate with any of the donor factors tested except death
		  to surgery time. The surgical success rate decreased when
		  the time from death to surgery was \&gt;7 days (p = 0.05),
		  mainly because of poor reepithelialization. Four years
		  after surgery, 24 grafts remained clear. The ECD had
		  decreased by 72+/-5\% in the clear grafts. CONCLUSIONS: Our
		  findings show that endothelial changes in imported donor
		  corneas do occur after transportation, but the surgical
		  success rate may not be influenced significantly if the
		  penetrating keratoplasty is performed within 7 days after
		  donor death. However, the ECD in the clear grafts 4 years
		  after surgery is low.}}

		  protection for electronically disseminated works on an open
		  network such as the Internet. The author points out that
		  worldwide networks are potentially very powerful and
		  inexpensive publishing tools, though many copyright holders
		  are still afraid to disseminate their works electronically
		  for fear of massive infringement taking place outside the
		  jurisdiction of U.S. courts. The author argues, however,
		  that it is not accurate to describe cyberspace as an
		  entirely ``lawless land'' where copyright infringers can
		  act anonymously. Though he agrees with many commentators
		  that ideally national copyright laws will need to be
		  harmonized, e.g., through the multilateral process already
		  initiated under the authority of the World Intellectual
		  Property Organization, the author argues that even today
		  contract law provides copyright owners with some viable
		  ways to protect their intellectual property in cyberspace.
		  He proposes a number of steps that they can take so as to
		  create binding contracts with potential infringers willing
		  to acquire the copyrighted works on-line throughout the
		  world. Such an agreement would provide sufficient
		  protection and would constitute the foundation for
		  acquiring royalties. While discussing transnational aspects
		  of cross-border dissemination of electronic works, the
		  author analyzes also the drafting process of the new art.
		  2B U.C.C. (licenses) and the limits of state contract law

	Optannote = {BACKGROUND: Of the many logistic issues addressed throughout the cadaveric organ donation process, timely access to the operating theater for surgical recovery of organs and tissues can be one of the most problematic. Delay in recovery adds to cost, risks organ viability, and compounds donor family anguish with compromise to donation consent. METHODS: From March 1 to November 30, 2001, 25 cadaveric donors were selected and successfully transferred from local donor critical care units to an off-site facility, which was constructed, equipped, and staffed to allow surgical recovery of organs and tissues. Assessment of the recovery process and outcome results was compared to 42 consecutive, hospital-based, organ recoveries within the Mid-American Transplant Services (MTS) organ procurement organization region. RESULTS: Twenty-five MTS-facility and 42 hospital organ recoveries were successfully conducted with no technical losses and satisfactory function in all 206 transplanted organs. From the MTS donor group, 7 hearts, 4 lungs, 21 livers, 28 kidneys, and 5 pancreases were successfully transplanted. Statistically significant in the MTS group was higher donor age (44.1 vs. 30.2 years), shorter total donor management time (539 vs. 718 min), reduced delay in start of surgery (25 vs. 77 min), shorter cold ischemia time for recovered pancreases (355 vs. 630 min), and reduced mean cost per donor (\$10,636 vs. \$12,918). There was no significant difference in race, gender, cause of death, vasopressor requirements, organs per donor recovered (3.12 vs. 3.62) or transplanted (2.60 vs. 3.36), rate of tissue recoveries (68% vs. 67%), total operating room time (207 vs. 200 min.), or cold ischemia time (excluding pancreas). CONCLUSIONS: Cadaveric-donor multiorgan and tissue recovery at this hospital-independent facility was successfully accomplished in a manner indistinguishable from conventional hospital organ and tissue recovery. The intended objectives of improved access to the operating theater were realized along with the added benefit of significant cost savings and convenience to hospital personnel and surgical recovery teams. },

		  technology and the arts. He not only demonstrates how
		  interfaces - those buttons, graphics, and words on the
		  screen through which we control information - influence our
		  daily lives, but also tracks their roots back to Victorian
		  novels, early cinema, and even medieval urban planning. The
		  result is a lush cultural and historical tableau in which
		  today's interfaces take their rightful place in the lineage
		  of artistic innovation. With Interface Culture, Johnson
		  charts the vital role interface design plays in modern
		  society. Just as the great novels of Melville, Dickens, and
		  Zola explained a rapidly industrializing society to itself,
		  he argues, Web sites, Microsoft Bob, flying toasters, and
		  the landscapes of video games tell the digital society how
		  to imagine itself and how to get around in cyberspace's
		  unfamiliar realm. The role once played by novelists is now
		  fulfilled by the interface designer, who has bridged the
		  gap between technology and everyday life by providing a
		  conceptual framework for the vast amounts of information
		  and computation that surround us. Johnson explores the
		  past, throwing light on the modern interface's roots. From
		  the great cathedrals of the Middle Ages to the rise of
		  perspective drawing in the Renaissance, from Enlightenment
		  satire to the golden age of television, Interface Culture
		  uses a wealth of venerable ``interface innovation'' to
		  place newfangled creations like Windows 95 and the Web in a
		  rich historical context. Interface Culture also looks at
		  the future - from what PC screens will look like in ten
		  years to how new interfaces will alter the style of our
		  conversation, prose, and thoughts. (Adapted from

	Abstract = {To date, most inquiries into race and cyberspace have
		  focused; on the 'digital divide' - whether racial
		  minorities have access to advanced computing-communication
		  technologies. This paper asks a more fundamental question:
		  Can cyberspace change the way that race functions in
		  American society? Professor Jerry Kang starts his analysis
		  with a social-cognitive account of American racial
		  mechanics that centers the role of racial schemers. These
		  schemes consist of racial categories, rules of racial
		  mapping that place individuals into these categories, and
		  racial meanings associated with each category. Ne argues
		  that cyberspace can disrupt racial schemas because it
		  alters the architecture of both identity presentation
		  (enabling racial anonymity and pseudonymity) and social
		  interaction (enabling increased interracial interactions).
		  Thus, cyberspace presents society with three design
		  options: abolition, which challenges racial mapping by
		  promoting racial anonymity; integration, which reforms
		  racial meanings by promoting interracial social
		  interaction; and transmutation, which disrupts the very
		  notion of fixed racial categories by promoting racial
		  pseudonymity (or 'cyber-passing'). After analyzing each
		  option's merits, Professor Kang concludes that society need
		  not adopt a single, uniform design strategy for all of
		  cyberspace. Instead, society can embrace a policy of
		  digital diversification, which explicitly zones different
		  cyber spaces according to different racial environments.
		  For example, most market places could be zoned abolition,
		  whereas mast social spaces could be zoned integration. By
		  encouraging: a diversified policy portfolio, society can
		  exploit synergies created by flexible zoning while avoiding
		  policy lock-in. Although cyberspace is no panacea for the
		  racial conflicts and inequality that persist, it offers
		  new, possibilities for furthering racial justice that
		  should not be wasted.}}

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our organ procurement organization has been
		  forced to liberalize the donor criteria in order to expand
		  the donor pool for pancreas transplantation. In this
		  report, we describe our experience using whole organ
		  pancreatic grafts from \&quot;marginal\&quot; donors, which
		  include grafts obtained from donors over 45 years of age
		  and from donors who were identified to be hemodynamically
		  unstable at the time of organ retrieval. METHODS: A
		  prospective study was performed between July 1994 and March
		  1998, during which time 137 pancreas transplants were
		  performed at our center using organs procured by our own
		  surgeons (organs sent by other teams were excluded). The
		  rapid en bloc technique was used exclusively. The use of
		  pancreatic grafts from marginal donors was analyzed for
		  short-term and overall graft survival, and for delayed
		  graft function and complications. RESULTS: Overall pancreas
		  graft survival for our series was 83\%, with a mean
		  follow-up of 23 months. There were 22 pancreas grafts from
		  donors over 45 years of age, 13 of whom were greater than
		  50 years of age. The actual graft survival rate of the
		  over-45 donor group was 86\%. Fifty-one grafts were removed
		  from hemodynamically unstable donors on high-dose
		  vasopressors. The actual graft survival in this group was
		  86\%. There was no significant difference found in graft
		  survival between recipients of pancreatic grafts from
		  marginal and nonmarginal donors. Delayed graft function was
		  exhibited by more recipients of grafts from donors on
		  high-dose vasopressors (P\&lt;0.05), but this had no effect
		  on long-term graft survival and endocrine function.
		  Recipients of marginal donor grafts did not have higher
		  rates of complication compared to recipients of nonmarginal
		  grafts. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we currently
		  employ a graft selection strategy not limited by donor age
		  or hemodynamic stability. Our selection of pancreas organs
		  for transplantation is based on careful inspection of the
		  pancreas and determination of the adequacy of the ex vivo
		  flush. Our results suggest that the current pancreas donor
		  pool may be expanded substantially.}}

	Abstract = {Both family consent and legal consent were required for
		  organ/tissue donation from non-heart-beating donors (NHBD)
		  in Taiwan. A district attorney had to come to the bedside
		  to confirm the donor's asystole, confirm the family
		  consent, and complete some legal documents before a legal
		  consent was issued for organ donation. The resultant warm
		  ischemic time would be unpredictably long and in fact
		  precluded the organ donation from NHBD in Taiwan. We
		  developed a method of using extracorporeal membrane
		  oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain NHBD for a longer time and
		  prevent warm ischemic injury of the donor abdominal organs.
		  After ventilator disconnection in NHBD, phentolamine and
		  heparin were injected and mannitol infusion was given.
		  After the donor's asystole was confirmed by the
		  electrocardiogram (EKG) strip recording, the ECMO support
		  was set up through the right femoral veno-arterial route,
		  an occlusion balloon catheter was inserted through the left
		  femoral artery to occlude the thoracic aorta, and bilateral
		  femoral arteries were ligated. Usually, the ECMO could
		  begin within 10 min after the donor's asystole. The ECMO,
		  combined with a cooler, provided cold oxygenated blood to
		  the abdominal visceral organs, and prevented their warm
		  ischemic injuries. Under the ECMO support (range: 45-70
		  min), eight renal grafts were procured from 4 NHBD. With
		  the exception of the first two renal grafts with delayed
		  function, all others had immediate function postoperatively
		  and dialysis was no longer needed. In conclusion, by our
		  ECMO technique, NHBD could be maintained for a longer time
		  and the renal grafts had better immediate postoperative
		  function than those reported by other methods.}}

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was undertaken to determine
		  the number of potential organ donors in a neurosurgical
		  intensive care unit and to record the actual number of
		  organ donations. The reasons for refusal of organ donations
		  were analysed with respect to the controversial public
		  discussion of the brain death concept and the
		  transplantation law in Germany. METHODS: From 1994 to 1997,
		  the number of cases of brain death, and the number of cases
		  in which relatives consented or refused to organ donation
		  as well as the number of actual organ explantations was
		  recorded. Over the same period, press reports of 5 German
		  language newspapers were analysed with regard to the
		  authors' position on brain death and transplantation law,
		  their qualification, intention, and mode of presentation.
		  RESULTS: Annually, about 70 deaths occurred on the
		  department's intensive care unit of which almost 30\% of
		  the patients were determined to have suffered brain death
		  without any obvious contraindications against organ
		  donation. The refusal rate of relatives rose from 56\% up
		  to 78\%, and the rate of organ donors thus decreased from
		  5\% in 1994 to 4\% presently in the department. About 100
		  reports were published each year in the analysed
		  newspapers, of which about 90\% voiced approval of organ
		  transplantation. During the review period, the depiction
		  became more objective (57\% in 1994 to 82\% in 1997) and
		  the suspicious attitude toward the technique of brain death
		  diagnosis declined. Whereas 50\% of the articles rejected
		  the brain death concept in 1994, this figure decreased to
		  39\% in 1997 and conversely the concept of consent rose
		  from 33\% in 1994 to 56\% in 1997. CONCLUSION: In Germany,
		  the relatives refusal rate in organ donation is
		  continuously high, presumable due to a depressing 39\% of
		  press reports rejecting the brain death concept, and
		  resulting in a very low number of organ donations. There is
		  hope that the transplantation law which has finally passed
		  German parliament in 1997, confirming the brain death
		  concept as well as the legal principle of prior consent by
		  the donor or consent by the relatives will eventually
		  result in an increase of organ donation especially when
		  supported by an educational campaign which is embodied in
		  the transplantation law.}}

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: Efforts to increase organ donation include
		  serious attempts in hospital settings, where unrealized
		  donation potential exists. Research on hospital donation
		  must include understanding organizational as well as
		  patient-specific influences on the donation process.
		  OBJECTIVE: To identify organizational characteristics that
		  distinguish hospitals producing organ donations from those
		  that do not, and to estimate the number of nondonor
		  hospitals with donor potential. DESIGN: Data from the
		  American Hospital Association's 1992 annual survey of
		  hospitals were matched to Organ Procurement and
		  Transplantation Network information from the United Network
		  for Organ Sharing regarding the number of solid-organ
		  donors in 1992. Hospitals with donation capability were
		  identified, based on bed size and factors necessary to
		  produce successful donor maintenance and organ recovery.
		  Based on statistical analyses, organizational
		  characteristics distinguishing donor hospitals from
		  nondonor hospitals were identified. We also compared the
		  number of donors and the number of donor hospitals in 1992
		  and 1996. SETTING: United States. RESULTS: Among all
		  hospitals affiliated with the American Hospital Association
		  (n = 5607), 1214 (22\%) were identified as donor hospitals
		  (> or = 1 donation in 1992). Of 2333 hospitals with
		  procurement capability, 1268 (54\%) produced no donors in
		  1992. Based on a multiple logistic regression model, donor
		  hospitals differed from nondonor hospitals by hospital
		  ownership, with municipally owned hospitals more likely and
		  federally owned hospitals less likely to produce donation,
		  compared with for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
		  Other organizational characteristics associated with donor
		  hospitals were level of trauma services, whether the
		  hospital had a transplant surgery program or a hospital
		  ethics committee, and whether it was located in the South
		  Atlantic, Southwest Central, or Pacific regions of the
		  United States. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitals not currently
		  producing organ donations, there is a sizable subgroup with
		  donor potential. This area merits further attention.}}

		  practice of democracy. Through participation in
		  associations, citizens both receive an education in public
		  affairs and create centers of political power independent
		  of the state. Essential to participation in an association
		  is participation in a forum, a communication space that
		  allows for many-to-many communication in which citizens can
		  'treat of public affairs in public' (Tocqueville, 1945
		  edition). Participation in forums suffers from numerous
		  barriers, however, eg, the need to meet in one common
		  place, the need to meet at one common time, and the
		  potentially high costs of participation. Online Internet
		  forums avoid many of these barriers, and, thus, they hold
		  the promise of facilitating the formation and operation of
		  citizen associations. This was confirmed in 1995 by the
		  experiences of a Boston (MA)-based citizen association, the
		  Telecommunication Policy Roundtable-Northeast (tpr-ne).
		  TPR-NE's uses of the Internet suggest that online forums
		  may allow associations to be more responsive, robust, and
		  able to unite more members. 37 References. Adapted from the

	Title = {Expanding the living related donor pool in renal transplantation: use of marginal donors.},
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: In a living related transplantation program it is
		  not always possible to find an ideal donor. Sometimes the
		  only available donor in the family has some benign disease
		  or suboptimal renal anatomy or physiology, or is too old to
		  be accepted and defined as a marginal donor. However, with
		  proper screening the donor pool can be increased by
		  accepting these marginal donors and treating the benign
		  diseases which is beneficial to the donor. We evaluate the
		  outcome of grafts from marginal donors. MATERIALS AND
		  METHODS: From July 1988 to August 1997, 581 live related
		  transplantations were performed. Of the donors 52 were
		  older than 60 years and 34 had associated benign renal or
		  nonrenal anomaly or disease. These donors were accepted
		  after thorough questioning and consultation with family
		  members. The recipients of graft from elderly donors were
		  evaluated for the number of rejections, serum creatinine at
		  last followup and graft survival. RESULTS: Of the
		  recipients 52 received grafts from elderly donors with a
		  mean age of 62.6+/-3.7 years. Mean followup was 34.14+/-0.7
		  months. The 2 and 5-year actuarial graft survival was 96\%
		  and 74\%, respectively. Creatinine was normal (less than
		  1.5) in 37\% of recipients and 1.5 to 2.5 mg.\% in 46\%.
		  The rejection rate in postoperative month 1 was 29\%. All
		  donors underwent simultaneous surgery to treat the benign
		  disease, and all did well after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: By
		  accepting these marginal donors a 14.6\% increase in the
		  living related donor pool was achieved without compromising
		  recipient or donor safety. Otherwise these recipients would
		  have been forced to undergo unrelated transplantation or be
		  maintained on dialysis, which is particularly difficult in
		  a developing country. Donors with associated disease
		  benefited from cure.}}

In this paper the relation between these procurement policies and kidney availability in the Eurotransplant region is examined. The opting out system turns out to be more favourable to kidney procurement than the opting in system. The approach of the next of kin with the donation question happens to be an important barrier for kidney procurement in the opting in system, but fails to appear under opting out. In the epilogue some remarks are made on the possibilities of introduction of the opting out system in countries now applying opting in.},

		  also hears of developers with no lives that work very hard
		  to achieve great product results. In this paper, I sought
		  empirical evidence that would help us understand which is
		  more common - the cave (i.e., lone producer) or the
		  community. Based on a study of the top 100 mature products
		  on Sourceforge, I find a few surprising things. First, most
		  OSS programs are developed by individuals, rather than
		  communities. The median number of developers in the 100
		  projects I looked at was 4 and the mode was 1 - numbers
		  much lower than previous numbers reported for highly
		  successful projects! Second, most OSS programs do not
		  generate a lot of discussion. Third, products with more
		  developers tend to be viewed and downloaded more often.
		  Fourth, the number of developers associated with a project
		  was positively correlated to the age of the project. Fifth,
		  the larger the project, the smaller the percent of project
		  administrators.},

	Title = {Early diagnosis of brain death in patients treated with central nervous system depressant drugs.},
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among the main causes for the relatively small
		  number of organ donors, the delay in the diagnosis of brain
		  death plays a major role. Administration of drugs causing
		  central nervous system (CNS) depression prevents diagnosis
		  of brain death by clinical and electroencephalographic
		  criteria until serum clearance of the drug has occurred.
		  Confirming brain death by demonstrating persistent
		  intracranial circulatory arrest might decrease the length
		  of the diagnostic process. We have carried out a
		  prospective study to investigate whether 99 mTc-hexamethyl
		  propylenamino oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) brain scintigraphy and/or
		  transcranial Doppler ultrasound can speed up the diagnosis
		  of brain death in patients treated with CNS depressant
		  drugs. METHODS: All 138 consecutive patients with severe
		  brain lesion that progressed to brain death in our center
		  between January 1994 and December 1996 were controlled. Of
		  them, 36 patients aged 1 to 65 years old (mean=25.6+/-18.3
		  years) who met clinical and EEG criteria for the diagnosis
		  of brain death, except for the presence of significant
		  serum levels of barbiturates (n=34), opiates (n=8), and
		  benzodiazepines (n=3) were distributed in three groups
		  according to the confirmatory test used; group 1: waiting
		  for the metabolic clearance of CNS depressant drugs, or by
		  demonstrating intracranial circulatory arrest with
		  99mTc-HMPAO (group 2) or transcranial Doppler (group 3).
		  The delay in diagnosing brain death by the three methods
		  was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean interval between the
		  presumptive and the definitive diagnosis of brain death was
		  34.4+/-32.2 hr in group 1, 17.7+/-18.3 hr in group 2, and
		  5.0+/-4.6 hr in group 3 (P=0.004). The between-groups
		  analysis showed that 99mTc-HMPAO and transcranial Doppler
		  decreased the delay in diagnosing brain death with respect
		  to waiting for drug clearance by 49\% (P=0.16) and 85\%
		  (P\&lt;0.001), respectively. Moreover, transcranial Doppler
		  decreased this time by 72\% with respect to 99mTc-HMPAO
		  (P\&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound
		  and 99mTc-HMPAO brain scintigraphy can significantly reduce
		  the time taken to confirm brain death in patients with
		  significant serum levels of CNS depressant drugs. In this
		  setting, transcranial Doppler is superior to 99mTc-HMPAO in
		  reducing the waiting time for a firm diagnosis of brain death.}}

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: National sharing of cadaveric renal allografts
		  for perfectly matched kidneys (0 antigen mismatch) has
		  improved outcome in the recipients of these kidneys despite
		  increasing cold storage times. However, there may be limits
		  to outcome improvement of matched kidneys based on age and
		  cold storage time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine if
		  national sharing of kidneys based on matching improves
		  outcome regardless of donor age and cold storage time, we
		  evaluated the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)
		  Scientific Registry for all recipients of cadaveric kidney
		  transplants between January 1, 1990 and July 31, 1998. We
		  divided the recipients into four groups based on donor age
		  and cold storage time. Group 1 comprised young donors
		  (donor age \&lt;55 years) with average (\&lt;24 h) cold
		  storage time; group 2, young donors with long (\&gt;/=24 h)
		  cold storage time; group 3, older donors (donor age
		  \&gt;/=55 years) with average cold storage time; and group
		  4, older donors with long cold storage time. RESULTS: A
		  total of 64,046 recipients were evaluated: 35,061 (55\%) in
		  group 1, 21,264 (33\%) in group 2, 4308 (7\%) in group 3,
		  and 3414 (5\%) in group 4. Early graft performance
		  progressively decreased from group 1 to group 4. Delayed
		  graft function (DGF: dialysis requirement in the first 7
		  days posttransplant) was 18, 29, 33, and 42\% (P \&lt;
		  0.0001); serum creatinine at 3 years (in mg/dl) was 1.70
		  +/- 0.8, 1.73 +/- 0.9, 2. 31 +/- 1.0, and 2.42 +/- 1.1 (P
		  \&lt; 0.0001); 1-year graft survival was 87, 84, 79, and
		  77\% (P \&lt; 0.0001); and 3-year graft survival was 77,
		  74, 63, and 62\% (P \&lt; 0.0001, for groups 1 and 2 vs
		  groups 3 and 4, respectively). The trends in DGF persisted
		  through the groups in 0 antigen mismatched kidneys.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Early function is adversely affected by
		  prolonged cold storage, despite matching, in recipients of
		  younger and older donor kidneys. Long-term function does
		  not appear to be affected by prolonged cold storage.
		  Recipients of kidneys from donors \&gt;/=55 years of age
		  have significantly worse short- and long-term outcome and
		  may not benefit from national sharing. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.}}

		  unconstitutional prior restraints. Even though libel may
		  inflict truly irreparable harm on its victim, the most a
		  libel plaintiff can hope for is damages, or perhaps a
		  permanent injunction after final adjudication, not
		  preliminary relief: Professors Lemley and Volokh argue the
		  same rule should apply to preliminary injunctions in many
		  copyright, trademark, right of publicity, and trade secret
		  cases. They note that intellectual property rights, unlike
		  other property rights, are a form of content- based,
		  government-imposed speech restriction. The mere fact that
		  the restriction is denominated a 'property right' should
		  not exempt it from conventional First Amendment scrutiny,
		  or justify government action that restricts speech which
		  ultimately proves to be constitutionally protected. This is
		  especially so because in most cases, damages would be a
		  relatively effective remedy. The Court's prior restraint
		  doctrine and sound First Amendment policy suggest that
		  preliminary injunctions in intellectual property cases are
		  often (though not always) unconstitutional.}}

		  federal and state intellectual property laws and policies
		  impose significant limits on the ability of states to
		  change the rules of intellectual property licensing by
		  contract law. One such limit is preemption, but preemption
		  is unlikely to provide significant protection for the
		  established rules of intellectual property law. Several
		  other doctrines will limit the ability of parties to set
		  their terms by contract, even in the Article 2B world. The
		  first is copyright misuse, which has been applied against
		  restrictive licensing provisions. The second set of
		  doctrines provides that a number of licensing rules are
		  decided as questions of federal, not state, Law. The third
		  set of doctrines is a number of state public policies that
		  cannot be overridden by contract. Taken together, these
		  doctrines create a patchwork public policy of intellectual
		  property law that Article 2B cannot alter.}}

		  software development, which involves developers at many
		  different locations and organizations sharing code to
		  develop and refine programs. To an economist, the behavior
		  of individual programmers and commercial companies engaged
		  in open source projects is initially startling. This paper
		  makes a preliminary exploration of the economics of open

		  economics, especially the literature on 'career concerns',
		  and industrial organization theory can explain many of
		  these projects' features. We conclude by listing
		  interesting research questions related to open source

		  the architecture and social systems that are changing every

		  Cyberspace is his well-reasoned, undeniably cogent series
		  of arguments for guiding the still-evolving regulatory
		  processes, to ensure that we don't find ourselves stuck
		  with a system that we find objectionable. As the former
		  Communist-bloc countries found, a constitution is still one
		  of our best guarantees against the dark side of chaos; and
		  Lessig promotes a kind of document that accepts the
		  inevitable regulatory authority of both government and
		  commerce, while constraining them within values that we
		  hold by consensus. Lessig holds that those who shriek the
		  loudest at the thought of interference in cyberdoings,
		  especially at the hands of the government, are blind to the
		  ever-increasing regulation of the Net (admittedly, without
		  badges or guns) by businesses that find little opposition
		  to their schemes from consumers, competitors, or cops. The
		  Internet will be regulated, he says, and our window of
		  opportunity to influence the design of those regulations
		  narrows each day. How will we make the decisions that the
		  Framers of our paper-and-ink Constitution couldn't foresee,
		  much less resolve? Lessig proclaims that many of us will
		  have to wake up fast and get to work before we lose the

		  constitutional scholar and former Industry Standard
		  columnist Lessig offered a wary assessment of both the
		  burgeoning architecture of the Internet and the work of
		  those seeking to control its growth. In this sprawling
		  follow-up, Lessig takes his arguments in Code to the next
		  level. Warning of a digital future that, despite all its
		  promise, could in fact turn out quite darkly, Lessig argues
		  that while most of the world is still pondering a digital
		  revolution, a counterrevolution is already underway.
		  Programmers are closing off Internet innovation through
		  code. And lawmakers, lobbied by entrenched commercial
		  interests, are applying overly broad interpretations of
		  copyright and intellectual property laws. To fully realize
		  the cultural and economic benefits of our technological
		  revolution, Lessig urges the creation of a public 'commons'
		  for the Internet, an open system that would allow for
		  quicker exchange of intellectual capital and offer future
		  innovators the ability to freely build upon the innovations
		  of others. Some of Lessig's sweeping proposals are sure to
		  spark a lively debate, but his well-reasoned, clearly
		  written argument is powerful. If we fail to deal
		  appropriately and immediately with the intellectual, legal,
		  cultural and economic issues associated with rapid
		  technological change, Lessig asserts, we risk not only
		  squandering the promise of the digital future, but
		  reverting to 'a dark age' of increased corporate and

		  Creating, identifying and protecting the information market

		  producers of those products and service seek to protect
		  their proprietary interest in the underlying information.
		  However, these actions have broader consequences: Attempts
		  to extend legal protection to basic facts and other public
		  domain information demonstrate that the public information
		  space is slowly being reduced. Reviewing several
		  information controversies as case studies is fruitful. Not
		  only for assessing current trends in information disputes
		  (warfare) but can form the basis for establishing several
		  predictors useful in determining when future information
		  ownership controversies may develop and result in the loss
		  of public information space. One set of predictors helps
		  define the information controversy and is descriptive. The
		  second set of predictors characterizes the marketplace
		  environment. It provides further nuance to the economic
		  factors that force information owners to seek legal remedy.
		  Identifying instances where both models suggest a change in
		  information rights or ownership is most likely to result in
		  the critical loss of access to public information space.}}

		  their clinical and pathological outcome. METHODS: The donor
		  had a diagnosis of lupus nephritis made by renal biopsy 5
		  years before donation. At the time of donation, a biopsy
		  was performed on the donor and on one of the recipients at
		  2 months and 1 year after the transplant. RESULTS: Both
		  recipients underwent uneventful renal transplantation. On
		  the first postoperative day, the donor's final pathological
		  results became available. Although the frozen section
		  seemed to be quite benign, the permanent sections revealed
		  World Health Organization Class II/V lupus nephritis, with
		  full house immunofluorescence and multiple electron dense
		  deposits. Biopsies were performed on recipient \#2 at 8
		  weeks and 1 year after the transplant. These revealed
		  marked diminution followed by complete resolution of all
		  tubular reticular structures and deposits as well as
		  immunofluorescent activity. Both recipients remain with
		  normal renal function and urinalysis at 3 years after the
		  transplant. CONCLUSION: Although a history of clinically
		  significant renal disease has been considered an absolute
		  contraindication to kidney donation, with appropriate
		  workup and caution, select patients may still be
		  considered, which would increase the potential donor pool.}}

		  it's hard to argue otherwise after reading it. Deliberately
		  freeing the volume from the shackles of academic rigor (and
		  jargon), Ludlow draws deeply from the cyber-underground and
		  mixes classic rants with post-millennial realism. From John
		  Perry Barlow's chestnut 'A Declaration of the Independence
		  of Cyberspace' to Jedediah Purdy's cautionary 'The God of
		  the Digerati,' the collection is direct, confrontational,
		  and thought-provoking. Though the topic of virtual
		  communities has been thoroughly explored elsewhere, the
		  possibility of spaces free from terrestrial
		  jurisdiction--called 'Temporary Autonomous Zones' by Hakim
		  Bey--has not yet penetrated mainstream thought. Strong
		  encryption and essential qualities of the Internet--like
		  portability--ensure that such utopias will remain
		  theoretically and practically tenable through the
		  foreseeable future, and Ludlow's visionaries want to see
		  them flower. The penultimate section on experimental
		  governing systems and the appended interview with Noam
		  Chomsky demolishing widely held beliefs about anarchy crown
		  the book with deep thinking about issues vital to the
		  future of freedom--online and off. It's exciting to see
		  this work get the widespread attention it deserves--with
		  any luck, the iconic Net user will soon trade in the pocket
		  protector for an eye patch. --Rob Lightner (Amazon) }}

	Abstract = {Renal transplantation is the ideal renal replacement
		  therapy for treatment of end stage kidney failure but its
		  limitation is the constant shortage of cadaveric donors.
		  While the traditional source of cadaveric kidneys is
		  procurement from heart-beating donors, organ procurement
		  from non-heart-beating donors (NHBD) would help in coping
		  with the rising demand for organs. However various
		  important legal, logistic and technical constraints have
		  limited the implementation of such a procurement programme.
		  Nevertheless, prolonged warm ischaemic times in procuring
		  kidneys from NHB donors may affect the viability of these
		  organs and adversely affect overall outcome after
		  transplant. Fifty-three consecutive patients who underwent
		  renal allotransplantation (Tx) between January and December
		  1994 at the Singapore General Hospital were retrospectively
		  reviewed. Outcomes after renal transplantation among 25
		  heart-beating donor (HBD) and 28 NHBD were compared.
		  Despite significant differences in donor age (23.7 +/- 11.0
		  and 34.1 +/- 7.9, P = 0.001), first warm (0 and 22.2 +/-
		  9.0 minutes) and cold ischaemic times (12.8 +/- 6.7 and 5.2
		  +/- 5.0 hours, P = 0.001) between the HBD and NHBD groups,
		  the two-year patient and graft survivals were very similar
		  in both groups (100\% versus 98\% and 98\% versus 96\%).
		  The incidence of delayed graft function (DF) was also
		  comparable between the HBD (41\%) and the NHBD (50\%) Tx.
		  These results suggest that NHBD is a viable source for
		  kidney transplants and comparable patient and graft
		  survivals can be achieved if the first warm and cold
		  ischaemic times are kept to the minimum.}}

DESIGN: Retrospective review of a 3-year experience at a Metropolitan Level I Trauma Center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 223 early deaths among 5,719 trauma patients in a 3-year period were reviewed. This group represented 62 percent of all trauma deaths. RESULTS: Forty-six patients (21 percent) donated 102 vascularized organs and made 66 donations of tissues. Patients with isolated severe head injuries had the highest rate of successful donation (33 percent). Those with severe head injury and another severe organ injury had a lower rate of donation (13 percent), and donation was rare (1 percent) among patients with severe organ injury in the absence of head injury (p < 0.001). There were no organ donors among victims >65 years old or in 64 of 65 patients with a Revised Trauma Score of <2.2. The Revised Trauma Score was significantly higher in organ donors (3.39 vs. 3.07, p < 0.05). The cost-benefit ratio for early deaths was \$6,512 per organ/tissue recovered.

		  distinctive appearance and behavior patterns, social
		  categorization, and certification via knowledge or
		  artifacts. A number of major rationales and contexts for
		  anonymity (free flow of communication, protection,
		  experimentation) and identifiability (eg, accountability,
		  reciprocity, eligibility) are identified, and a principle
		  of 'truth in the nature of naming,' which holds that those
		  who use pseudonyms on the Internet in personal
		  communications have an obligation to indicate they are
		  doing so, is suggested. In an effort to guide the
		  development and assessment of any Internet policy regarding
		  anonymity, 13 procedural questions are offered. 3 Tables,

		  pairs from 10 experimental and 10 control Intensive Care
		  Units undertook two standardized simulated relative
		  encounters (Breaking Bad News and Donation Request) at
		  three measurement points (pre, post and follow-up). Nurses
		  showed no change in communication skills. Experimental
		  group doctors showed significant improvement in breaking
		  bad news and requesting donation; most of these
		  improvements were not maintained. Control group doctors
		  showed some improvement in breaking bad news, indicating
		  that participating in measurement by itself initiates some
		  transient change in communication skills. Attendance at
		  EDHEP does lead to significant improvement in some, but not
		  all, communication skills essential in breaking bad news
		  and requesting donation. Further research is necessary to
		  determine what factors additional to EDHEP will contribute

METHODS: An international trauma survey questionnaire was developed. Analysis of two responding centers with regard to organ donation practices between urban, free-standing adult trauma hospitals is presented: the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center (STC) in Baltimore, Maryland, and the Lorenz Bohler Hospital (LBH) in Vienna, Austria. RESULTS: Hospital admissions resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) account for a significantly greater number of admissions at the STC than at the LBH (761 vs. 276), and the STC has a higher number of patients admitted with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 8). Of 39 medically suitable brain-dead patients at the STC, 18 went to organ donation. At the LBH, 16 patients were declared brain-dead, 7 were considered to be medically suitable, and all 7 went to donation. A 'presumed consent' organ donation policy in Austria resulted in 100\% of medically suitable patients going to donation at the LBH. With a volunteer donation policy at the STC, 46\% of patients went to donation. Of those families who refused donation at the STC, 9 of 16 eligible African Americans (56\%), 10 of 21 eligible Caucasians (48\%), 1 Hispanic, and 1 Native American Indian family declined donation. CONCLUSION: 'Presumed' organ donation in Austria led to 4 organs transplanted per trauma brain-death at the LBH, as compared with 3.8 organs per brain-death at the STC. The greater number of patients with severe TBI at the STC accounts for a similar organ donation rate compared with the LBH, despite the fact that the consent at the STC is voluntary and at the LBH is 'presumed.' A higher organ donation rate in the United States would result in a greater number of organ transplants from patients who die after traumatic injury and a resultant increase in potential lives saved. There does not appear to be a significant difference in ethnicity between families who accept and those who refuse organ donation after traumatic brain death declaration at the STC.},

		  availability, as is the case of liver procurement from
		  elderly donors. So far, results reported in the literature
		  are controversial and only a few reports described
		  satisfactory outcomes of transplantation using donors older
		  than 60 years. In the case presented herein, we report the
		  successful elective liver transplantation of a 65 year-old
		  patient, who received a graft from an 87 year-old donor,
		  whose well-preserved hemodynamic conditions, normal hepatic
		  function, absence of parenchymal alterations, as well as
		  short ischemia time, were the key points for this good
		  outcome. Even very old donors can be suitable for liver
		  transplantation. A careful evaluation of all the possible
		  donor-related risk factors, mostly the presence of
		  steatotic changes at liver biopsy, is always mandatory.}}

		  transactions, Merges contends that ``repeat players''
		  (individuals and firms that frequently need to exchange
		  rights) can and often do take steps to overcome
		  transactional bottlenecks. Whether through copyright
		  collectives, such as ASCAP and BMI in the music industry,
		  or undertakings such as patent pools in automobile and
		  aircraft manufacturing, those with a recurring need to
		  transact in intellectual property rights invest in
		  administrative structures that lower the costs of
		  exchanging rights. Among other functions, these collective
		  rights organizations promulgate rules and procedures for
		  placing a monetary value on members' property rights. They
		  thus conserve on transaction costs either by making it
		  easier to identify and locate rightholders, or by creating
		  the occasion for repeat-play, reciprocal bargaining, versus
		  more costly one- shot exchanges, Drawing on a body of
		  academic literature known as the new institutional
		  economics, Professor Merges explains and analyzes the
		  origins and operation of these organizations. Professor
		  Merges applies his observations and theoretical insights to
		  an important contemporary controversy: whether Congress
		  ought to legislate a compulsory license for digital content
		  needed by the multimedia industry. He argues that it should
		  not. Given the underlying economics, and consistent with
		  experience in other industries, existing intellectual
		  property rights will force industry participants to invest
		  in institutions to conduct transactions. Indeed, consistent
		  with the analysis in this Article, evidence indicates this
		  is already occurring.}}

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The shortage of cadaveric livers has sparked
		  an interest in adult-to-adult living donor transplantation.
		  Right lobe donor hepatectomy is frequently required to
		  obtain a graft of adequate size for adult recipients.
		  Careful donor selection is necessary to minimize
		  complications and assure a functional graft. METHODS: A
		  four-step evaluation protocol was used for donor selection
		  and satisfactory results of all tests in each step were
		  required before proceeding to the next. Donors were
		  selected based on a battery of laboratory studies chosen to
		  exclude unrecognized infection, liver disease, metabolic
		  disorders, and conditions representing undue surgical risk.
		  Imaging studies included ultrasonography, angiography,
		  magnetic resonance imaging, and intraoperative
		  cholangiography and ultrasonography. The information
		  obtained from liver biopsy was used to correct the
		  estimated graft mass for the degree of steatosis. RESULTS:
		  From March 1998 to August 1999, 126 candidates were
		  evaluated for living donation. A total of 35 underwent
		  donor right lobectomy with no significant complications.
		  Forty percent of all donors that came to surgery were
		  genetically unrelated to the recipient. A total of 69\% of
		  those evaluated were excluded. ABO incompatibility was the
		  primary reason for exclusion after the first step (71\%)
		  and the presence of steatosis yielding an inadequate
		  estimated graft mass after the second step (20\%).
		  CONCLUSIONS: Donor selection limits the application of
		  living donor liver transplantation in the adult population.
		  Unrelated individuals increase the size of the donor pool.
		  Right lobe hepatectomy can be performed safely in healthy
		  adult liver donors. Preoperative liver biopsy is an
		  essential part of the evaluation protocol, particularly
		  when the estimated graft mass is marginal.}}

		  countries of the world have made tremendous strides in
		  organ donation and transplantation. However, in this area
		  of medicine, Japan has been slow to follow. Japanese
		  ethics, deeply rooted in religion and tradition, have
		  affected their outlook on life and death. Because the
		  Japanese have only recently started to acknowledge the
		  concept of brain death, transplantation of major organs has
		  been hindered in that country. Currently, there is a dual
		  definition of death in Japan, intended to satisfy both
		  sides of the issue. This interesting paradox, which still
		  stands to be fully resolved, illustrates the contentious
		  conflict between medical ethics and medical progress in
		  Japan.}}

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over a 12 month period, the Israel Transplant
		  Center doubled the number of donors by assigning a nurse
		  coordinator to each of 22 hospitals around the country and
		  by using kidneys from elderly donors. OBJECTIVE: To
		  evaluate the impact of our \&quot;marginal donors\&quot;
		  policy on the results immediately following
		  transplantation. METHODS: Between October 1997 and
		  September 1998, 140 cadaveric kidney transplantations from
		  72 donors were performed in Israel. We defined two groups
		  of recipients: patients with immediate graft function and
		  patients with either delayed graft function requiring \&gt;
		  1 week of dialysis post-transplant or with primary graft
		  non-function. We compared the following parameters between
		  groups: donor and recipient age and gender, cause of
		  donor's death, length of stay in the intensive care unit,
		  vasopressor dosage and creatinine levels before harvesting,
		  cold ischemic time, and the number of recipient grafts.
		  RESULTS: There were 102 recipients (72.8\%) with immediate
		  graft function and 38 with either PNF (n = 13, 9.3\%) or
		  DGF (n = 25, 17.9\%). On regression analysis, donor age
		  \&gt; 50 year and retransplantation were significant risk
		  factors for PNF or DGF (odds ratio 4.4 and 2.8,
		  respectively). Of the 56 kidneys from donors \&gt; 50 years
		  old, 21 (37.5\%) developed either PNF (n = 9) or DGF (n =
		  12). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that kidneys from donors over
		  age 50 are at increased risk for graft non-function or
		  delayed function. Better assessment of functional capacity
		  of kidneys from \&quot;aged\&quot; donors may help to
		  choose appropriate donors from that pool.}}

		  of the donation process. The aim of this prospective study
		  was to describe the content of interviews with the families
		  of potential donors and to analyze their reactions to
		  improve the process of eye donation. METHODS: We
		  consecutively met with 151 families of suitable corneal
		  donors at the Rouen University Hospital. All interviews
		  with donor families were analyzed using a preestablished
		  questionnaire. RESULTS: In only 17.9\% of cases was the
		  family aware of the potential donor's last will. In 77.7\%
		  of these cases, the patient wished to donate. Procurement
		  rate was 71.5\%. This acceptance was mostly facilitated by
		  the awareness and motivation of the hospital staff, the
		  experience of the physician, and the 13.3-h period of time
		  allowed after the donor's death. The commitment on the part
		  of the ophthalmologist to carry out optimal anatomical
		  restoration was a very important point for 32\% of families
		  who accepted donation. Twenty-one percent of families asked
		  for a delay for reflection. This delay helped to obtain a
		  positive response in 72.7\% of cases and even sometimes
		  helped families to reconsider a previously negative
		  position (14\% of initial refusals). CONCLUSION: We
		  demonstrate that a high positive response (71.5\%) can be
		  obtained from the donor's family when a trained and
		  motivated group manages the post-mortem cornea donation request.}}

		  Project--and takes it as far as the end of 2000--with
		  GNU/Linux becoming a worldwide phenomenon that runs

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single wedge biopsy of cadaveric kidneys from
		  donors older than 55 is currently the standard method of
		  evaluating their viability for transplantation. The degree
		  of glomerulosclerosis presently determines whether a kidney
		  can be transplanted, but most biopsies sample only the
		  subcapsular region and may not accurately represent the
		  true renal architecture. Our study evaluated the accuracy
		  of transplant suitability determinations based upon the
		  single wedge biopsy of cadaveric kidneys. METHODS: We took
		  kidneys that were refused by UNOS centers on the basis of
		  biopsy results, examined their histology in detail, and
		  reviewed donor medical histories. Sections were taken from
		  the upper, lower, and mid-portion of each kidney and
		  stained with the periodic acid Schiff stain. Percentage and
		  location of glomerulosclerosis and other relevant pathology
		  were then determined in each section. We compared our
		  findings with the results of the original wedge biopsies
		  obtained at the time of procurement. RESULTS: Nine kidneys
		  were obtained and examined. The wedge biopsies at the time
		  of procurement showed glomerulosclerosis ranging from 8 to
		  36\% (median 17\%). The multiple kidney sections we
		  analyzed showed fewer sclerosed glomeruli, ranging from 3
		  to 15\% (median 7\%, P\&lt;0.001), with most of the
		  sclerosed glomeruli identified located in the immediate
		  subcapsular region (P\&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Wedge
		  biopsies of donor kidneys can overestimate the total amount
		  of glomerulosclerosis, apparently because of a predominance
		  of sclerosis in the kidney's subcapsular region, the area
		  predominantly sampled by the usual wedge biopsy. These
		  inappropriately high estimates of glomerulosclerosis can
		  result in refusal of kidneys that might be suitable for
		  transplantation.}}

	Abstract = {Article 2B of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.)
		  provides model rules to govern transactions in the digital
		  domain, such as the licensing of software and electronic
		  contracting. By addressing fundamental contract issues in
		  the burgeoning world of digital commerce, it provides a
		  salutary update to extant provisions of the U.C.C, dealing
		  with traditional goods sold in traditional modes of
		  commerce. However, to the extent that Article 2B aspires to
		  protect copyright owners from improper uses of copyrighted
		  works, it solves a non-problem. Copyright owners already
		  enjoy robust and adequate protections under the Copyright
		  Act. Far more troubling than solving this non- problem,
		  however, is the possibility that Article 2B will be used to
		  upset copyright law's 'delicate balance' between the rights
		  of copyright owners and copyright users. This balance is
		  disrupted when state law is permitted to enlarge the rights
		  that copyright owners enjoy. Attempts to alter the
		  'delicate balance' through contract should fail under the
		  doctrine of preemption. Article 2B assumes a pose of
		  neutrality on the extent to which copyright Law preempts
		  contractual encroachment, yet it facilitates emerging
		  practices designed to alter the balance and place the
		  burden of defending the proper bounds of copyright on
		  copyright users. In this Article, the authors argue that if
		  Article 2B is to be enacted, it must proscribe contracting
		  practices that seek to extend copyright protection beyond
		  its current scope.}}

	Optannote = {BACKGROUND: The potential supply of transplantable cadaver kidneys is often expressed as donors per million population (pmp), which ignores some essential factors governing organ donation. METHODS: We performed a modeled analysis of kidney donor extraction rates by age, gender, race, cause of death, geographic region, and year in a cohort of evaluable deaths and actual cadaver donors between the ages of 1 and 65 years (1988-1993). Evaluable death was defined as an in-hospital death in patients between the ages of 1 and 65 years whose ICD-9-CM cause of death was not an obvious contraindication to kidney donation. The main outcome measures were the crude donation rate and an adjusted donor extraction rate (DER) per 1000 evaluable deaths. RESULTS: A total of 1.4x10(6) in-hospital deaths produced 300,502 evaluable deaths and 20,575 actual donors. Between 1989 and 1993, DER increased from 61.1 to 75 per 1,000 evaluable deaths. DERs were highest among the youngest age groups, declining significantly with age from 405.0 to 16.7/1,000 evaluable deaths for age groups 1-10 and 56-65 years, respectively. There was a small difference in donors pmp between blacks and whites (15 vs. 18). In contrast, DER was seven times higher in whites compared with blacks (112.5 vs. 16.5/1,000 evaluable deaths; P<0.001). The crude donation rate (per 1,000 evaluable deaths) was high for stroke (604.8) and trauma-related deaths (230.6), resulting in highly efficient donor extraction from these deaths. Region-specific DERs ranged from 49.4 to 83/1,000 evaluable deaths and differed significantly from the corresponding donors pmp. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating kidney donation relative to in-hospital evaluable deaths is a meaningful measure of organ procurement efficiency. Efforts to enhance cadaveric kidney donation should seek to understand and reduce the marked demographic and regional disparity in donor extraction rates. },

	Abstract = {The incentive to develop intrafamilial living related
		  liver transplantation (LRLT) originated from the shortage
		  of cadaveric organ supply. We report our experience with
		  LRLT in 63 children during 1993-1998 in the frame of a
		  protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of our
		  Institution. During this period, 152 potential
		  intrafamilial (mostly parental) donors were evaluated; 44
		  (28.5\%) were excluded because of surgical (n = 4), medical
		  (n = 39) or psychosocial reason (n = 1). Out of 108 who
		  matched all medical, surgical and psychological criteria of
		  selection, 45 did not underwent living donation because
		  their child received a cadaveric graft (n = 22; LRLT was
		  their second option) or because one of the parents who had
		  both been selected was chosen [by the surgical team because
		  of more favourable anatomy (n = 8) or by mutual agreement
		  between the two parents (n = 5)]. Sixty-three living donors
		  (36 mothers, 24 fathers, one grand mother, one aunt and one
		  uncle) underwent procurement of the left lobe (n = 52), the
		  left lobe extended to part of segment IV (n = 8) or a left
		  hepatectomy (n = 3) without mortality or any serious
		  morbidity. Their median hospital stay was 7 days (range:
		  6-12); full physical rehabilitation and normalization of
		  liver tests were usually obtained within three weeks. Their
		  psychological follow-up did not disclose any longstanding
		  serious sequellae. The median age of the recipients was 13
		  months (range 5-189); 30 were younger than one year at the
		  time of transplant. Their median weight was 8.1 kg (range:
		  4.3 to 60); 36 had an actual weight under 10 kg. Fifty-two
		  received an ABO identical and 11 received an ABO compatible
		  transplant. The native liver diseases were similar to
		  common data in children, with biliary atresia being the
		  most frequent indication (74.6\%). The median weight of the
		  graft was 260 gr (range: 138-680) with a median ratio
		  between the graft weight and the recipient body weight of
		  3.17\% (range: 0.75-8.08). All grafts were implanted
		  orthotopically with semi-microvascular reconstruction of
		  the hepatic vein, portal vein and hepatic artery [end to
		  end anastomosis in 58 (2 arteries were reconstructed in 7
		  patients) and interposition of an iliac arterial allograft
		  from the infrarenal aorta in 5]. Base line
		  immunosuppression consisted of a triple drug regimen
		  including steroids, Azathioprine and either
		  Cyclosporine-Sandimmun (n = 9), Cyclosporine Microemulsion
		  formulation-Neoral (n = 13) or Tacrolimus-Prograft (n =
		  41). Biopsy-proved acute rejection was treated with
		  intravenous bolus of steroids; steroid-resistant acute
		  rejection was treated by a switch from Cyclosporine to
		  Tacrolimus or addition of Mycophenolate-Mofetil (Cellcept)
		  in Tacrolimus treated patients. Actuarial patient survival
		  was 91.8\% and 89.6\% after LRLT at one and five years
		  post-transplant, respectively, and 87.5\% and 82.8\% at one
		  and five years, respectively, in 90 patients who received a
		  cadaveric graft during the same interval. Actuarial graft
		  survival was 91.8\% and 84.1\% after LRLT at one and five
		  years, respectively, and 76.4\% and 73.3\% at one and five
		  years, respectively, after cadaveric transplants. Vascular
		  thrombosis was observed in 9.5\% of the patients (arterial
		  thrombosis: 1.6\%; portal thrombosis: 7.9\%) without graft
		  loss. Biliary complications were observed in 26.9\% (bile
		  leak from cut surface in 3.1\%, anastomotic stricture in
		  22.2\% and intrahepatic stricture in 1.5\%); two patients
		  died from septic shock possibly related to uncompletely
		  relieved anastomotic stricture; all other biliary
		  complications were successfully treated either
		  conservatively or surgically. The incidence of acute
		  rejection was 90.9\% in 22 patients with Cyclosporine-based
		  immunosuppression; acute rejection was corticoresistant in
		  50\%. It was 46.3\% in 41 patients with Tacrolimus-based
		  immunosuppression (64\% with Prograft in capsules and
		  18.7\% with Prograft in granules); no acute rejection was
		  corticoresistant. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)}}

		  obvious contraindication to kidney donation. The main
		  outcome measures were the crude donation rate and an
		  adjusted donor extraction rate (DER) per 1000 evaluable
		  deaths. RESULTS: A total of 1.4x10(6) in-hospital deaths
		  produced 300,502 evaluable deaths and 20,575 actual donors.
		  Between 1989 and 1993, DER increased from 61.1 to 75 per
		  1,000 evaluable deaths. DERs were highest among the
		  youngest age groups, declining significantly with age from
		  405.0 to 16.7/1,000 evaluable deaths for age groups 1-10
		  and 56-65 years, respectively. There was a small difference
		  in donors pmp between blacks and whites (15 vs. 18). In
		  contrast, DER was seven times higher in whites compared
		  with blacks (112.5 vs. 16.5/1,000 evaluable deaths;
		  P\&lt;0.001). The crude donation rate (per 1,000 evaluable
		  deaths) was high for stroke (604.8) and trauma-related
		  deaths (230.6), resulting in highly efficient donor
		  extraction from these deaths. Region-specific DERs ranged
		  from 49.4 to 83/1,000 evaluable deaths and differed
		  significantly from the corresponding donors pmp.
		  CONCLUSIONS: Estimating kidney donation relative to
		  in-hospital evaluable deaths is a meaningful measure of
		  organ procurement efficiency. Efforts to enhance cadaveric
		  kidney donation should seek to understand and reduce the
		  marked demographic and regional disparity in donor
		  extraction rates.}}

Because these factors may be correlated with socioeconomic status, the failure to control for them may have led to bias in other studies. The authors merged data from secondary sources with telephone survey data from a national sample of 456 end-stage renal disease patients to show how estimates of the effects of socioeconomic factors change when self-reported health and functional status and attitudes about treatment are incorporated into statistical models. The authors also showed how kidney transplant rates would change if socioeconomic factors no longer influences organ allocation decisions. METHODS: Weibull proportional hazard analyses were used to show relationships between socioeconomic measures and waiting list entry and kidney transplant rates, before versus after accounting for self-reported health and functional status, attitudes about treatment, and other variables. Simulation analyses were used to estimate the number of waiting list spots and transplant operations that would move from economically advantaged to disadvantaged persons if socioeconomics no longer influenced organ allocation decisions. RESULTS: Incorporating information about health and functional status, attitudes about treatment, and other factors into the hazard models often reduced the estimated impact of socioeconomic measures on the odds of (1) being on a waiting list for a cadaver kidney transplant and (2) receiving a transplant. Simulations showed that 30 to 65 waiting list spots or transplant operations per 1,000 patients would shift from economically advantaged to disadvantaged persons if socioeconomics no longer influenced organ allocation decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Successful efforts to level the playing field would result in substantial redistributions of kidney transplants from economically advantaged to disadvantaged persons.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that pharmacologic
		  conditioning of the donor before organ procurement may
		  protect the renal allograft from injuries associated with
		  the cold ischemic period. We compared the administration of
		  two vasoactive agents before organ procurement to: (1)
		  determine their influence on machine perfusion
		  characteristics and (2) determine their impact on delayed
		  graft function (DGF) in transplanted renal allografts.
		  METHODS: Between January 1997 and December 1998, 150
		  kidneys were procured from heart-beating donors and
		  preserved in our laboratory by machine perfusion (MP) or
		  cold storage (CS). The following vasoactive agents were
		  randomly administered to the donor 5 min before aortic
		  cross clamp: phentolamine mesylate (PM) or hydralazine (H).
		  The control groups received no donor conditioning. Kidneys
		  were grouped as follows: (1) MP+PM, (2) MP+H, (3) MP, (4)
		  CS+PM, (5) CS+H, (6) CS. 10 mg PM/50 kg donor weight was
		  administered to the PM groups and 20 mg H/50 kg donor
		  weight was administered to the H groups. DGF was defined as
		  the need for dialysis within the first 7 days after the
		  transplant. RESULTS: MP+PM increased renal flow by 12\% and
		  decreased renal resistance by 18\% compared with the MP+H
		  group, and increased renal flow by 23\% and decreased renal
		  resistance by 30\% compared with the MP group. Moreover,
		  the MP+PM group was associated with improved early
		  allograft function. CONCLUSIONS: Donor treatment with PM
		  immediately before aortic cross-clamp is associated with
		  improved machine perfusion dynamics (renal flow and renal
		  resistance) and lower incidence of DGF compared with donor
		  treatment with H or no treatment. Moreover, MP of renal
		  allografts was associated with improved early function
		  compared with CS grafts.}}

		  systems that implement interaction with multiple databases
		  through a common interface, and with multiple databases as
		  if they were one (integrated interaction) in an experiment
		  in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) environment,
		  Twenty-eight volunteers were recruited from the graduate
		  students of the School of Communication, Information, \&
		  Library Studies at Rutgers University. Significantly more
		  subjects preferred the common interface to the integrated
		  interface, mainly because they could have more control over
		  database selection. Subjects were also more satisfied with
		  the results from the common interface, and performed better
		  with the common interface than with the integrated
		  interface. Overall, it appears that for this population,
		  interacting with databases through a common interface, is
		  preferable on all grounds to interacting with databases
		  through an integrated interface, These results suggest
		  that: (1) the general assumption of the information
		  retrieval (IR) literature that an integrated interaction is
		  best needs to be revisited; (2) it is important to allow
		  for more user control in the distributed environment; (3)
		  for digital library purposes, it is important to
		  characterize different databases to support user choice for
		  integration; and, (4) certain users prefer control over
		  database selection while still opting for results to be
		  merged.}}

		  Economic geography in an era of global competition poses a
		  paradox. In theory, location should no longer be a source
		  of competitive advantage. Open global markets, rapid
		  transportation, and high-speed communications should allow
		  any company to source any thing from any place at any time.
		  But in practice, location remains central to competition.
		  Clusters are critical masses in one place of linked
		  industries and institutions --- from suppliers to
		  universities to government agencies ---- that enjoy unusual
		  competitive success in a particular field. The most famous
		  examples are found in Silicon Valley and Hollywood, but
		  clusters dot the world's landscape. The more complex,
		  knowledge-based, and dynamic the world economy becomes, he
		  argues, the more competitive advantage lies in local
		  things--knowledge, relationships, and motivation--that
		  distant rivals cannot replicate. }}

		  hardware and software elements that populate this new
		  place, and the communication protocols that allow these
		  elements to interact with one another-defines the
		  architecture of this new space and is of paramount
		  importance in determining how it will be regulated. As an
		  anthropology of the various new regulatory and
		  quasi-regulatory structures that may arise on the global
		  network, Lessig's book is captivating and often dazzling;
		  he demonstrates, compellingly, that cyberspace is a place
		  in which code dominates, a world in which 'code is law.' As
		  a normative call to arms, however, the book is somewhat
		  less successful. Lessig argues that because we are the code
		  writers-because cyberspace is a made, not a found,
		  world-control over the code needs to be subject to
		  political, collective decisionmaking. Post suggests several
		  reasons why this conclusion might not follow as smoothly

	Abstract = {Considers the usefulness of postmodern theories to an
		  analysis of the relation of the Internet to democracy. It
		  is suggested that the primary difficulties in employing
		  such theories is the inadequate development of a fully
		  postmodern theory of politics and the persistence of
		  democracy, a modern category, as a dominant political norm
		  and ideal. However, despite their limitations, postmodern
		  theories are an excellent starting point for examining
		  cyberdemocracy, if only because the Internet deeply
		  troubles basic assumptions of older positions. One path
		  toward developing a postmodern theory of cyberdemocracy may
		  be developed through the concept of the public sphere.
		  Jurgen Habermas's (1989) Model of the public sphere is
		  rejected in favor of a model that stresses its contentious,
		  gender, fractured nature. Viewed in this manner, the public
		  sphere might be invigorated by the Internet because this
		  technology radically decenters political speech and, thus,
		  opens the possibility of greater cultural negotiation and
		  conflict. The case of gender in Internet communication is
		  discussed as an example of this process. It is concluded
		  that, because the Internet reconfigures the practice of
		  self-constitution in the public sphere, it also allows the
		  reconfiguration of the political itself. 34 References. D.

		  this retrospective study, the outcome of kidney
		  transplantation using cadaveric pediatric donors was

		  procurement took place in two regions of Italy
		  (Emilia-Romagna and Piemonte) over an 11-year period. A
		  group of pediatric donors (\&lt; 15 years old, n = 30) was
		  compared with an adult donor group (n = 67). All recipients
		  were adults who received cyclosporin as immunosuppression.
		  Actuarial patient and graft survival rates did not differ
		  significantly between the two groups (patient survival 96\%
		  and 96\% for pediatric donors versus 98\% and 92\% for
		  adult donors at 1 and 5 years post-transplantation; graft
		  survival 76\% and 68\% for pediatric donors versus 88\% and
		  74\% for adult donors 1 and 5 y post-transplantation).
		  Complications were also evaluated, but no difference was
		  found (the only exception being the creatinine level in the
		  5th year). Renal transplantation with cadaveric donors
		  starting at 4 years of age gave results comparable to
		  kidneys coming from adults. These data show that cadaveric
		  pediatric donor kidneys may be used in adult recipients
		  with good results. The ethical implications of the subject

Other books may show how to use today's widgets and interface ideas effectively. Raskin, however, demonstrates that many current interface paradigms are dead ends, and that to make computers significantly easier to use requires new approaches. He explains how to effect desperately needed changes, offering a wealth of innovative and specific interface ideas for software designers, developers, and product managers. The Apple Macintosh helped to introduce a previous revolution in computer interface design, drawing on the best available technology to establish many of the interface techniques and methods now universal in the computer industry. With this book, Raskin proves again both his farsightedness and his practicality. He also demonstrates how design ideas must be built on a scientific basis, presenting just enough cognitive psychology to link the interface of the future to the experimental evidence and to show why that interface will work. Raskin observes that our honeymoon with digital technology is over: We are tired of having to learn huge, arcane programs to do even the simplest of tasks; we have had our fill of crashing computers; and we are fatigued by the continual pressure to upgrade. The Humane Interface delivers a way for computers, information appliances, and other technology-driven products to continue to advance in power and expand their range of applicability, while becoming free of the hassles and obscurities that plague present products.

		  (ESRD) is 17 times greater in African Americans, this
		  minority group, which comprises only 12\% of the U.S.
		  population, represents 34\% of the dialysis population and
		  30\% of the national kidney waiting list. Furthermore,
		  while black individuals comprise 22-24\% of kidney
		  recipients, they comprise only 8-11\% of donors. Because of
		  the histocompatibility differences between the races and
		  because tissue matching is part of the United Network for
		  Organ Sharing (UNOS) allocation formula, African Americans
		  wait twice as long for kidneys as Caucasians. Also, because
		  they get more poorly matched organs, their kidney
		  transplant graft survival is 10-20\% lower than that for
		  other racial groups. The African American community is
		  unaware of the special needs in members of their own race.
		  Steps must be taken to increase minority awareness of the

	Abstract = {Renal cholesterol embolization (RCE) in native kidneys has
		  a dismal outcome and frequently leads to irreversible renal
		  failure. RCE may rarely occur in renal allografts as well,
		  particularly if the recipient or the donor has prominent
		  atherosclerosis. The natural history of RCE in renal
		  transplants is unknown. We have reviewed the surgical
		  pathology files of The Johns Hopkins Hospital in the
		  14-year period between 1984 and early 1999 and found 7 RCE
		  cases among 1500 renal transplant biopsies (0.47\%). One of
		  the seven cases had three biopsies showing cholesterol
		  emboli, the first of which was a postreperfusion (immediate
		  posttransplant) biopsy. The probable source of the
		  cholesterol emboli was the recipient in six cases and the
		  donor in one case. Five donors were cadaveric and two were
		  living donors. Six biopsies were taken within the first 4
		  months posttransplant (four were postreperfusion biopsies).
		  One recent patient had the inciting event of arteriography
		  and stent placement 2 years posttransplant and is currently
		  doing well. One kidney failed due to posttransplant
		  lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), another kidney failed
		  with complicating opportunistic infections, and the other
		  five were functioning 2 to 6 years posttransplant. A
		  literature review revealed additional 14 RCE cases in renal
		  transplants. Combining our cases with those in the
		  literature (21 cases), reveals that the origin of the RCE
		  was probably the recipient in 11 cases (seven cadaveric,
		  two living-related, and two unknown), and the donor in 10
		  cases (eight cadaveric and two unknown). Graft failure
		  occurred in two of the 11 cases, where RCE was of probable
		  recipient origin. Seven of the 10 kidneys, where the RCE
		  was probably of donor origin, failed due to allograft
		  dysfunction; one of them also developed superimposed
		  rejection and cytomegalovirus infection. We conclude that
		  if RCE is originating in the recipient, graft survival is
		  usually good. In contrast, if RCE is of donor origin, graft
		  dysfunction and subsequent graft loss are common. The
		  reason for this difference may be the more extensive RCE
		  developing in an atherosclerotic cadaveric donor during
		  organ procurement or severe trauma leading to death.}}

		  relatives' organs at a single hospital. MAIN OUTCOME
		  MEASURE: Consent to donate. RESULTS: Based on a stepwise
		  discriminant function analysis, the following variables
		  played a determining role in a family member's decision to
		  donate: (1) the expressed wish of the deceased, (2) having
		  a clear understanding of the definition of \&quot;brain
		  death.\&quot; (3) the manners and approach of the doctors,
		  (4) the hospital facilities, (5) concerns regarding the
		  donation process, and (6) educational level. CONCLUSION:
		  Prodonation campaigns geared toward the public and hospital
		  staff should focus on specific objectives to increase the
		  likelihood of consent for organ donation.}}

	Title = {Split-liver transplantation: a comparison of ex vivo and in situ techniques.},
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The expanding applicability of liver
		  transplantation as treatment for end-stage liver disease
		  has fostered a disproportionate increase in liver
		  transplant candidates in the face of an unchanging pool of
		  donor organs. This has resulted in disparities in
		  pretransplant waiting times and deaths. The splitting of a
		  liver allograft allows for the transplantation of 2
		  recipients, usually an adult and a child, thus providing a
		  means to expand the cadaveric donor pool. METHODS: The
		  authors present their results on the performance of an ex
		  vivo (back table) split and in situ (in a hemodynamically
		  stable cadaveric donor) split to evaluate safety,
		  applicability, and effectiveness. Between November 1989
		  through April 1998, 54 split-liver transplant recipient
		  operations were performed (24 pediatric and 30 adult).
		  Thirty donors were procured: the ex vivo splitting yielded
		  25 grafts from 13 donors (donor age, 24.6+/-11 years), and
		  the in-situ technique yielded 29 grafts from 17 donors
		  (mean donor age of 25.5+/-10.4 years). Five donors involved
		  interinstitutional sharing for which the left side of the
		  graft was kept at the host hospital and the right side
		  grafts were utilized at our center. RESULTS: Overall 1-year
		  patient survival was 85\%, with a graft survival of 72\%.
		  Patient survival was similar with ex vivo (74\%) as
		  compared with the in situ splitting group (96\%; P = .06),
		  as was graft survival in ex vivo (61 \%) versus in situ
		  (81\%) splitting (P = .15). The pediatric population
		  benefited most from the in situ technique, with a 1-year
		  patient survival rate of 100\% with the in situ technique
		  versus the ex vivo technique survival rate of 64\% at 1
		  year (P = .02). The 1-year graft survival comparing these 2
		  techniques was 83\% for the in situ group versus 45\% for
		  the ex vivo group. Analysis of the program evolution of
		  split-liver transplantation suggested a time-dependent
		  learning curve, which was applicable to surgical splitting
		  technique, implantation, and recipient selection.
		  CONCLUSIONS: The principle of splitting livers from
		  cadaveric donors is fundamentally sound and technically
		  feasible. The authors' outcomes analysis using 2 different
		  procurement techniques suggests that the in situ technique
		  is clinically efficacious, can be used alternatively with
		  the ex vivo technique, and is comparable to whole-liver
		  allograft transplantation.}}

In fact, Belgium, a country that approved a presumed consent law in 1986, has been the first country in the world to establish in 1987 already an at that time unique computerized network that allows citizens to register their objections against (or explicit consent to) donating their organs and tissues after death (1). When setting up a non-donor registry in 1987, a computerized network already linked all Belgian municipalities with the State Registry of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, containing e.g. all administrative data from each individual. Citizens 'able to express their will' can register their objections against organ or tissue donation in their local town-hall. A file extract containing only the individual's will about donation is downloaded on a daily base into a smaller database at the Ministry of Health's Information Centre. All procurement transplant coordinators in Belgium have an individual password protected access to this computer. Consultation of this database, to check whether a referred donor had objected against donation during life, is mandatory before surgeons can proceed with any organ or tissue removal. At the end of 1995, the cumulative registered objections totaled 160,425 Belgians (1.75\% of the native Belgian population) and 29,757 foreigners (3.23\% of the foreigners residing in Belgium)(2). Apart from Belgium, non-donor registries already existed also in Austria, and have been established recently also in Sweden and the Netherlands.},

But transplantation has become a victim of its own success. The demand for human organs can no longer be met and deaths of persons on waiting lists have more than doubled since 1988. A number of alternatives have been proposed to fill the gap between the supply and demand of organs and the past few years have seen the development of various approaches derived from recent advances in biotechnology. Among these technologies is xenotransplantation - the transplantation of viable cells, tissues and organs from one animal species to another. Xenotransplantation of cells and tissues has been approved for clinical trials in a number of OECD countries. However, opinions about the risks from these early procedures and whether to proceed any further vary. At the New York 1998 Workshop on 'International issues in transplantation biotechnology including the use of non-human cells, tissues and organs', world leaders in the field reported on the state of the art and unmet needs in transplantation, addressing in particular the potential, the risks, the ethics and socio-economic impacts of xenotransplantation. Based on presentations, transcripts of round-table discussions and comments raised at the workshop, this book provides an overview of the field and of current regulatory frameworks and addresses the most pressing international policy considerations on xenotransplantation.},

PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-one people who had been approached for the donation of their deceased relatives' organs at a single hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Consent to donate. RESULTS: Based on a stepwise discriminant function analysis, the following variables played a determining role in a family member's decision to donate: (1) the expressed wish of the deceased, (2) having a clear understanding of the definition of 'brain death.' (3) the manners and approach of the doctors, (4) the hospital facilities, (5) concerns regarding the donation process, and (6) educational level. CONCLUSION: Prodonation campaigns geared toward the public and hospital staff should focus on specific objectives to increase the likelihood of consent for organ donation},

		  radial artery (RA). To investigate the morbidity and
		  functional outcome of RA harvest. METHODS: The
		  neurovascular fascia surrounding the RA is divided. Only
		  loose areolar tissue surrounds this artery making harvest
		  of RA simple and allowing minimal trauma to the RA and
		  surrounding muscles. Topical and intraluminal vasodilators
		  but no systemic vasodilators are used. RESULTS: RA harvest
		  commenced in December 1994. Between 1996 and 30 June 1998,
		  2167 RA were harvested and used to construct 3105 coronary
		  anastomoses. A dramatic rise in RA use occurred during
		  1996. More than 80\% of patients undergoing coronary artery
		  bypass surgery (CABG) have RA harvested since this time.
		  Total arterial revascularization rate also rose
		  dramatically and is currently 80\% of all CABG. This rate
		  has been assisted by a rapid rise in the use of composite
		  arterial grafting where aortic anastomoses can be avoided
		  and currently represents 40\% of all CABG. Hand strength
		  was tested in 328 non-selected patients and was not reduced
		  by RA harvest when hand dominance was taken into account.
		  Objective sensation loss was present in 0.3\% for the
		  superficial radial nerve and 2.1\% for the lateral
		  cutaneous nerve of forearm. Pulse oximetry observations
		  detected statistically significant but clinically
		  irrelevant differences. Scar hypersensitivity occurred in
		  20\%. Only two patients of all patients undergoing RA
		  harvest reported late hand ischaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Harvest
		  of the RA within the neurovascular plane is simple and
		  associated with low morbidity.}}

	Annote = {From Baudelaire's confrontation with the specter of art
		  photography to the present age of mirror shades,
		  Pentium-envy and ambient dance tracks, Rutsky provides a
		  fairly comprehensive, though sometimes fluidly categorized,
		  overview of the development of the modern ``aesthetic of
		  technology.'' For Rutsky, technology, once clearly defined
		  as ``other'' than what is human, has perhaps replaced
		  religion and psychology as the main source of metaphors for
		  how the mind (and soul) work. Citing a range of modern
		  philosophers and thinkers from Heidegger, Benjamin and
		  Duchamp to the inevitable William Gibson and the doyenne of
		  cyber-aesthetics, Donna Haraway, the book covers a lot of
		  ground--Shelley's Frankenstein, the constructivist films of
		  Vertov, a reading of William Gibson via Frederic Jameson, a
		  long section on Fritz Lang's film Metropolis and a detour
		  into a theory of Nazism and Hitler fascination as the
		  fervid fetishizing of an androgynous leader. Rutsky falters
		  a bit when it comes to contemporary art and cultural
		  practices, where some fieldwork and reportage would have
		  given his examples more punch. Like George Landow's paean
		  to cyberculture, Hypertext, the book is best on how
		  thinking about technology helps resolve certain
		  philosophical conundrums--organic vs. mechanic; rational
		  vs. irrational; masculine vs. feminine--that have plagued
		  the West, perhaps even providing the ground for a total
		  unified field theory. Lucid and cogent in its presentation
		  of highly complicated issues, this study will reward those
		  interested in the fatal attraction of art and culture.

		  individuals property rights in their personal data to
		  promote information privacy in cyberspace. A property
		  rights approach would allow individuals to negotiate with
		  firms about the uses to which they are willing to have
		  personal data put and would force businesses to internalize
		  a higher proportion of the societal costs of personal data
		  processing. However, granting individuals property rights
		  in personal information is unlikely to achieve information
		  privacy goals in part because a key mechanism of property
		  law, namely the general policy favoring free alienability
		  of such rights, would more likely defeat than achieve
		  information privacy goals. Drawing upon certain concepts
		  from the unfair competition-based law of trade secrecy,
		  this article suggests that information privacy law needs to
		  impose minimum standards of commercial morality on firms
		  engaged in the processing of personal data and proposes
		  that certain default licensing rules of trade secrecy law
		  may be adapted to protect personal information in

		  specific rules of allocation. We have retrospectively
		  evaluated the French liver transplant waiting list for the
		  period 1992-1996, during which time the rules for
		  allocation remained stable. Mortality while on the waiting
		  list and waiting times were the two principal endpoints.
		  METHODS: Using the Etablissement Francais des Greffes (EFG)
		  registry, the study was conducted in three steps: (1)
		  description of the waiting list population; (2) analysis of
		  the outcome of patients, with the use of a logistic model
		  to explain death while on the waiting list; (3) estimation
		  of waiting times and use of a Cox model to explain waiting
		  times. RESULTS: The distribution of patients with regard to
		  degree of urgency, age, blood type, and liver disease was
		  variable according to the the EFG region. The outcome of
		  patients was variable according to blood type and to EFG
		  region. Patients classed as \&quot;extremely urgent\&quot;
		  did not have a different outcome compared to elective
		  patients. The logistic model indicated that two factors
		  influenced the death: blood group and EFG region. Waiting
		  times were variable according to EFG region; age and blood
		  group had an influence on waiting times for a graft. The
		  Cox model indicated the independent influence of EFG region
		  on waiting times. CONCLUSION: We found geographical
		  disparities between patients with respect to time on the
		  waiting list. However, the database must be improved by
		  including the risk profile of each patient, leading to
		  changes in rules for a better allocation of transplants.}}

	Abstract = {In this Article, Professor Schwartz depicts the widespread
		  silent collection of personal information in cyberspace. At
		  present, it is impossible to know the fate of the personal
		  data that one generates online. Professor Schwartz argues
		  that this state of affairs degrades the health of a
		  deliberative democracy; it cloaks in dark uncertainty the
		  transmutation of Internet activity into personal
		  information that will follow one into other areas and
		  discourage civic participation. This situation also will
		  have a negative impact on individual self- determination by
		  deterring individuals from engaging in the necessary
		  thinking out loud and deliberation with others upon which
		  choice-making depends. In place of the existing privacy
		  horror show on the Internet, Professor Schwartz seeks to
		  develop multidimensional rules that set out fair
		  information practices for personal data in cyberspace. The
		  necessary rules must establish four requirements: (1)
		  defined obligations that limit the use of personal data:
		  (2) transparent processing systems; (3) limited procedural
		  and substantive rights; and (4) external oversight. Neither
		  the market nor industry self- regulation are likely,
		  however, to put these four practices in place. Under
		  current conditions, a failure exists in the 'privacy
		  market.' Moreover, despite the Clinton Administration's
		  endorsement of industry self-regulation, this method is an
		  unlikely candidate for success. Industry self- regulation
		  of privacy is a negotiation about 'the rules of play' for
		  the use of personal data. In deciding on these rules,
		  industry is likely to be most interested in protecting its
		  stream of revenues. Therefore, it will benefit if it
		  develops norms that preserve the current status quo of
		  maximum information disclosure. This Article advocates a
		  legislative enactment of the four fair information
		  practices. This legal expression of privacy norms is the
		  best first step in promoting democratic deliberation and
		  individual self-determination in cyberspace.,Tt will
		  further the attainment of cyberspace's potential as a new
		  realm for collaboration in political and personal
		  activities. Enactment of such a federal law would be a
		  decisive move to shape technology so it will further-and
		  not harm-democratic self-governance.}}

However, such incentives may lead to weakening of altruism and exploitation of poor families. We investigated dialysis patient attitudes toward the potential benefits and problems of incentives. Using a structured questionnaire, we interviewed 60 randomly selected patients at three chronic hemodialysis units. Subjects were asked to make an explicit trade-off between maintaining altruism versus increasing the supply of kidneys. They were also asked to make a trade-off between protecting poor families versus increasing the supply of kidneys. In addition, we asked subjects how they thought incentives would affect donation by different types of families. We found that 37 percent of all subjects placed more emphasis on maintaining altruism, 42 percent placed more emphasis on increasing the supply of kidneys, and 22 percent placed an equal emphasis on maintaining altruism and on increasing the supply of kidneys. Similarly, 35 percent of all subjects placed more emphasis on protecting poor families, 33 percent placed more emphasis on increasing the supply of kidneys, and 32 percent placed an equal emphasis on protecting poor families and on increasing the supply of kidneys. Subjects thought financial incentives would greatly increase donation by poor families while having little impact on rich families. In conclusion, even though dialysis patients are likely to benefit from increasing the supply of kidneys, many of them want to maintain altruism and protect poor families even if that means fewer kidneys. These concerns should be addressed in proposals to modify the transplant system.},

		  the Internet and, in turn, the information superhighway
		  have been popularly heralded as having the potential to

		  examination of the information superhighway's role in
		  education has taken place. Here, popular conceptions of the
		  educational superhighway are contrasted with the likely
		  social and cultural implications of the 'wired' school.
		  Examined first are three central claims made about the
		  information superhighway in education: (1) the unbridled
		  access to information it will afford teachers and learners;
		  (2) the potential for interactive communication with other
		  individuals; and (1990) The equality it will imbue. These
		  popular discourses are then contrasted with two fundamental
		  characteristics of the information superhighway often
		  overlooked by its advocates: the different quality of
		  learning experienced online and the educational
		  implications of the inherent economic nature of the
		  emerging information superhighway. Suggested in conclusion
		  is an alternative approach to examining the implementation
		  of the information superhighway in an educational context.

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: Transplantation has become the therapy of choice
		  for patients with organ failure. However, the low rate of
		  consent by families of donor-eligible patients is a major
		  limiting factor in the success of organ transplantation.
		  OBJECTIVE: To explore factors associated with the decision
		  to donate among families of potential solid organ donors.
		  DESIGN AND SETTING: Data collection via chart reviews,
		  telephone interviews with health care practitioners (HCPs)
		  or organ procurement organization (OPO) staff, and
		  face-to-face interviews with family for all donor-eligible
		  deaths at 9 trauma hospitals in southwestern Pennsylvania
		  and northeastern Ohio from 1994 to 1999. PARTICIPANTS:
		  Family members, HCPs, and OPO staff involved in the
		  donation decision for 420 donor-eligible patients. MAIN
		  OUTCOME MEASURE: Factors associated with family decision to
		  donate or not donate organs for transplantation. RESULTS: A
		  total of 238 of the 420 cases led to organ donation; 182
		  did not. Univariate analysis revealed numerous factors
		  associated with the donation decision. Multivariable
		  analysis of associated variables revealed that family and
		  patient sociodemographics (ethnicity, patient's age and
		  cause of death) and prior knowledge of the patients' wishes
		  were significantly associated with willingness to donate
		  (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.68; 95\% confidence interval
		  [CI], 6.55-9.01). Families who discussed more topics and
		  had more conversations about organ donation were more
		  likely to donate (adjusted OR, 5.22; 95\% CI, 4.32-6.30),
		  as were families with more contact with OPO staff (adjusted
		  OR, 3.08; 95\% CI, 2.63-3.60) and those who experienced an
		  optimal request pattern (adjusted OR, 2.96; 95\% CI,
		  2.58-3.40). Socioemotional and communication variables
		  acted as intervening variables. CONCLUSIONS: Public
		  education is needed to modify attitudes about organ
		  donation prior to a donation opportunity. Specific steps
		  can be taken by HCPs and OPO staff to maximize the
		  opportunity to persuade families to donate their relatives'
		  organs. }}

	Abstract = {The Kidney Transplantation Program at Ramathibodi Hospital
		  was established in 1985. By the end of 1998, there were
		  1,614 patients on the cumulative waiting list. The first
		  kidney transplantation (KT) was started in 1986 by using
		  kidney from living-related donor (LD) while cadaveric KT
		  (CD-KT) was started in 1987. A total of 528 KT were done,
		  278 cases (52.7\%) were CD-KT and 250 cases (47.3\%) were
		  LD-KT. Six patients had two kidney transplants. 278 kidneys
		  were donated from 189 cadaveric donors. Fifty cadaveric
		  donors (26.4\%) were from Ramathibodi Hospital while the
		  rest were from other hospitals and the Organ Donation
		  Center, Thai Red Cross Society. For LD, 233 out of 250
		  (93.2\%) were from living-related, more than 50 per cent of
		  these donors were from siblings. 17 spousal donors have
		  been accepted for KT at Ramathibodi Hospital since 1997.
		  Concerning the recipient pools, 522 patients (32.3\%) were
		  transplanted, 123 patients (7.6\%) died without KT, 111
		  patients (6.9\%) underwent KT at other hospitals, and 78
		  patients (4.8\%) changed to waiting lists at other
		  hospitals. The rest were lost to follow-up. At present,
		  only 265 patients are still actively waiting (send serum
		  every month). The number of KT and living donors has
		  gradually increased, whereas, the number of cadaveric
		  donors has decreased. However, cooperation with the
		  \&quot;Organ Donation Center\&quot; has improved the number
		  of cadaveric donation in the last two years. Sufficient
		  organ donations and an active working team will provide a
		  good kidney transplant service for the patients.}}

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well established that repeat heart
		  transplantation has a significantly worse outcome when
		  compared with primary (first time) transplantation.
		  Defining the risk factors for mortality within this group
		  has been difficult due to small numbers of patients at
		  individual centers. METHODS: All cardiac retransplants
		  performed in the United States and registered in the Joint
		  International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation
		  (ISHLT)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Thoracic
		  Registry were analyzed for demographics, morbidity
		  posttransplantation, immunosuppression, and risk factors
		  for mortality. RESULTS: The study cohort included 514
		  patients of which 81\% were male with a mean age of 47+/-12
		  years. Time from primary transplant to retransplantation
		  ranged from 1 day to 15.5 years and more than 50\% of the
		  patients underwent retransplantation for chronic rejection.
		  More than 60\% of patients were in the intensive care unit
		  at the time of retransplantation and more than 40\% of the
		  patients were reported to be on some form of life support
		  (ventricular assist device, ventilator, and/or inotropic
		  therapy). Survival for the entire retransplant cohort was
		  65, 59, and 55\% for 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, but
		  was substantially lower when the intertransplant interval
		  was short. Conversely, when the interval between primary
		  and retransplantation was more than 2 years, 1 year
		  survival postretransplantation approached that of primary
		  transplantation. Additional independent risk factors for
		  mortality for the retransplant cohort included overall
		  cardiac transplant center volume, the use of a ventricular
		  assist device or ventilator, the patient being in the
		  intensive care unit, and recipient age. The four most
		  common causes of death were infection, primary/nonspecific
		  graft failure, chronic rejection (allograft vasculopathy),
		  and acute rejection. CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm that
		  repeat heart transplantation is a higher risk procedure
		  than primary transplantation, especially early after the
		  primary heart transplant.}}

	Abstract = {Intact or inactivated donor lymphoid cells have been found
		  to downregulate the alloimmune response in a number of
		  experimental models. We conducted a randomized,
		  prospective, double blind, and placebo-controlled trial to
		  determine whether heat-treated donor spleen cells would
		  affect early rejection after liver transplantation. Donor
		  spleen was obtained during organ procurement for 40
		  patients undergoing liver transplantation. All patients
		  were treated with cyclosporine, azathioprine and steroids.
		  The patients were randomized after surgery to receive
		  either heat-treated (45 degrees C for 1 h) spleen cells or
		  placebo. Patients underwent protocol biopsies at 1 wk, 4
		  and 12 months, or as needed. Biopsies were reviewed in a
		  blind fashion and scored according to the Banff consensus
		  criteria. Randomization resulted in 19 patients in the
		  spleen cell group and 21 in the placebo group. One-yr graft
		  survival was 94 and 100\%, respectively. Early rejection
		  was more frequent in the spleen cell group (61 vs. 35\%, p,
		  not significant). The histopathological rejection activity
		  index at 7 d was also higher for the patients in the spleen
		  cell group: 39\% of spleen cell treated patients had a
		  score of 4 or higher as opposed to 5\% in the placebo group
		  (p \&lt; 0.01). The mean score was 2.9 +/- 2.8 for the
		  spleen cell group versus 1.3 + 1.7 for the placebo group (p
		  = 0.034). It is concluded that heat-treated donor spleen
		  cells given within 24 h after liver transplantation were
		  not clinically beneficial and increased the intensity of
		  rejection in 7-d protocol liver biopsies.}}

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the survival and
		  midterm function of kidneys from non-heart beating donors
		  (NHBD) with those of kidneys from heart beating donors
		  (HBD). From 1989 to 1998, 144 kidneys were procured from
		  NHBD at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos in Madrid, of which
		  95 were transplanted. The kidney grafts were maintained
		  from the moment of the diagnosis of cardiac arrest until
		  the time of procurement by cardiopulmonary bypass. There
		  was no significant difference in renal function and the
		  number of rejection episodes between the NHBD and HBD
		  transplants. The NHBD kidneys showed a 5.73-fold increase
		  in the incidence of delayed graft function (adjusted
		  relative risk 95\% confidence interval, 2.82 to 11.62).
		  One- and five-year survival rates for NHBD grafts were 84.6
		  and 82.7\%, respectively, compared with 87.5 and 83.9\% for
		  HBD (P = 0.5767). Cox analysis showed that the predictive
		  factors for worse NHBD graft survival were type of NHBD
		  donor and the occurrence of corticoresistant rejection.
		  Ninety of the NHBD organs were procured from subjects
		  suffering irreversible cardiac arrest on the street who
		  were transferred to our center for the sole purpose of
		  donation. Fifty-four of these kidneys were transplanted and
		  all showed primary function. When a strict protocol is
		  adhered to, the outcome of renal transplant from NHBD
		  compares well with that from HBD. It is believed that the
		  high number of organs obtained from subjects undergoing
		  irreversible cardiac arrest on the street might encourage
		  the adoption of new criteria for the management of this
		  type of pathology with the ultimate goal of kidney donation.}}

DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: All deaths by cause in the United States during 1993-1994 as reported in the Vital Mortality Statistics, Multiple Cause of Death files. The OPO-specific data were provided by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). STUDY DESIGN: Each OPO's expected number of donors was calculated by applying national donation rates to deaths with potential for donation in 24 age, sex, and race cells. The SDR was calculated by dividing the observed number of donors by the expected number. The chi2 tests of the hypothesis that the OPO's performance differed from the national norm of 1.0 were performed. The SDR was compared to the existing performance standard based on the unadjusted number of donors per million live population in the OPO's service area. An ordinary least squares (OLS) regression assessed predictors of the SDR. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The SDRs ranged from 0.41 to 1.99. Twenty-nine of 64 OPOs had SDRs significantly different than 1.0. The SDRs were positively associated with the percent of white living population and the number of organ types transplanted per transplant center served by the OPO. CONCLUSIONS: The SDRs can be used by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), UNOS, and OPOs to target quality improvement initiatives, present more accurate comparisons of OPO performance, and develop public policy on the evaluation of the effectiveness of organ procurement efforts. },

	Abstract = {Donor hypernatremia was reported to cause postoperative
		  graft dysfunction in human orthotopic liver transplantation
		  (OLT). However, the effects of the correction of donor
		  hypernatremia before organ procurement have not been
		  confirmed. The aim of this study is to determine whether
		  donor hypernatremia is associated with early graft
		  dysfunction after OLT and to determine the effect of the
		  correction of donor hypernatremia. One hundred eighty-one
		  consecutive OLTs performed between May 1997 and July 1998
		  were entered onto this study. The cases were divided into
		  three groups according to the donor serum sodium
		  concentration: group A, serum sodium of 155 mEq/L or less
		  before organ procurement (n = 118); group B, peak sodium
		  greater than 155 mEq/L and final sodium 155 mEq/L or less
		  (n = 36); and group C, final sodium greater than 155 mEq/L
		  (n = 27). Graft survival within 90 days after OLT and early
		  postoperative graft function were analyzed. There were no
		  significant differences in donor and recipient variables
		  among the three groups. The frequencies of graft loss were
		  15 of 118 grafts (12.7\%) in group A, 4 of 36 grafts
		  (11.1\%) in group B, and 9 of 27 grafts (33.3\%; P \&lt;.05
		  v groups A and B) in group C. The liver enzyme values in
		  groups B and C were significantly greater than those in
		  group A postoperatively. The prothrombin times of group C
		  were significantly longer than those of group A for the
		  first 4 postoperative days. Recipients of hepatic
		  allografts from donors with uncorrected hypernatremia had a
		  significantly greater incidence of graft loss compared with
		  recipients of hepatic allografts from normonatremic donors.
		  However, the differences in graft survival were abrogated
		  by the correction of donor hypernatremia before procurement.}}

	Abstract = {Hepatic allografts from donors who have suffered a brief
		  cardiopulmonary arrest may sustain ischemic damage before
		  organ procurement. However, there is no reported
		  correlation between donor cardiopulmonary arrest and
		  hepatic allograft dysfunction. On the other hand, brief
		  ischemia-reperfusion injury has been shown experimentally
		  to result in protection in several organ models. Induction
		  of ischemic tolerance has been called ischemic
		  preconditioning. Our objective was to study the influence
		  of brief donor cardiopulmonary arrest on hepatic allograft
		  outcome in human liver transplantation. Between May 1997
		  and July 1998, 181 consecutive orthotopic liver transplant
		  (OLT) cases were divided into 2 groups based on the
		  occurrence of donor cardiopulmonary arrest. Group A
		  consisted of 37 donors who suffered a cardiopulmonary
		  arrest. Group B consisted of the remaining 144 patients.
		  Liver graft survival within 90 days of OLT and early
		  postoperative graft function were analyzed. Although there
		  was significant liver damage resulting from circulatory
		  failure during cardiopulmonary arrest before organ
		  procurement in group A, graft survival was not affected.
		  After OLT, the mean peak aspartate transaminase and alanine
		  transaminase concentrations in group A (1, 444.1 and 718.2
		  U/L) were significantly lower than those in group B
		  (2,382.8 and 1,507.3 U/L) (P \&lt;.05). Experiences of
		  brief cardiopulmonary arrest in organ donors did not affect
		  post-OLT hepatic allograft survival and function. Although
		  the liver function tests are elevated in an organ donor,
		  the hepatic allograft is suitable for OLT if the liver
		  damage is induced by brief donor cardiopulmonary arrest.}}

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of insurance status on
		  access to kidney transplantation among California dialysis
		  patients. STUDY SETTING: California Medicare and Medicaid
		  dialysis populations. STUDY DESIGN: All California ESRD
		  dialysis patients under age 65 eligible for Medicare or
		  Medicaid in 1991 (n = 9,102) took part in this cohort
		  analytic study. DATA COLLECTION: Medicare and California
		  Medicaid Program data were matched to the Organ Procurement
		  and Transplantation Network Kidney Wait List files.
		  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Only 31.4 percent of California
		  Medicaid dialysis patients were placed on the kidney
		  transplant waiting list compared to 38.8 percent and 45.0
		  percent of dually eligible Medicate/Medicaid and Medicare
		  patients, respectively. Compared to the Medicaid
		  population, Medicare enrollees were more likely to be
		  placed on the kidney transplant waiting list (adjusted
		  Relative Risk [RR] = 2.10, Confidence Interval [CI] 1.68,
		  2.62) as were dually eligible patients (RR = 1.54, CI 1.24,
		  1.91). Once on the waiting list, however, Medicare
		  enrollment did not influence the adjusted median waiting
		  time to acquire a first cadaveric transplant (p \&gt; .05).
		  CONCLUSIONS: California dialysis patients excluded from
		  Medicare coverage, who are disproportionately minority,
		  female, and poor, are much less likely to enter the U.S.
		  transplant system. We hypothesize that patient concerns
		  with potential subsequent loss of insurance coverage as
		  well as cultural and educational barriers are possible
		  explanatory factors. Once in the system, however, insurance
		  status does not influence receipt of a cadaveric renal
		  transplant.}}

		  incisive look into the still-raging debate over open source
		  code. In his own words (interspersed with co-writer
		  Diamond's tongue-in-cheek accounts of his interviews with
		  the absentminded Torvalds), the programmer relates how it
		  all started in 1981 with his grandfather back in Finland,
		  who let him play around on a Vic 20 computer. At 11 years
		  old, Torvalds was hooked on computersespecially on figuring
		  out how they ran and on improving their operating systems.
		  For years, Torvalds did little but program, upgrading his
		  hardware every couple of years, attending school in a
		  desultory fashion and generally letting the outside world
		  float by unnoticed, until he eventually wrote his own
		  operating system, Linux. In a radical move, he began
		  sharing the code with fellow OS enthusiasts over the
		  burgeoning Internet in the early 1990s, allowing others to
		  contribute to and improve it, while he oversaw the process.
		  Even though Torvalds is now a bigger star in the computer
		  world than Bill Gates, and companies like IBM are running
		  Linux on their servers, he has retained his innocence: the
		  book is full of statements like 'Open source makes sense'
		  and 'Greed is never good' that seem sincere. Leavened with
		  an appealing, self-deprecating sense of humor and a
		  generous perspective that few hardcore coders have, this is
		  a refreshing read for geeks and the techno-obsessed.}}

		  The argument applies Erik Erikson's (1963 [1950]) notion of

		  opportunity to experiment with different personae online
		  contributes to the construction of a more comprehensive
		  self-identity. Further, these separate identities challenge
		  the psychoanalytic notion of a unitary self, with computer
		  experiences illustrating a decentered identity composed of
		  a multiplicity of personality facets that remain part of a
		  comprehensive whole. A brief case study illustrates. 11

	Abstract = {A homograft valve bank for cryopreservation of cardiac
		  homografts was established at the Institute of
		  Cardiovascular Diseases in July 1995. From July 1995 to
		  February 1999, 169 donor hearts were processed. All except
		  four hearts were procured post mortem. Aortic valves (149)
		  and pulmonary valves (139) were the common homografts
		  dissected out for use. The valves were immersed in a
		  cocktail of five broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungals
		  for an average of 48 to 72 hours before cryopreservation.
		  Fifty-three (35.57\%) aortic and 42 (30.21\%) pulmonary
		  valves had to be discarded for various reasons like fungal
		  contamination, failure to sterilise, HBsAg positivity etc.;
		  153 homografts have been released for use so far. Analysing
		  the usual methods of procurement, sterilisation protocol,
		  culture and cryopreservation used for cardiac homografts at
		  this centre, this paper recommends observance of
		  timeliness, use of appropriate media for preservation of
		  heart parts, administration of specific drugs and

		  nephritis and 463,141 adults with other causes of ESRD who
		  were included in the US Renal Data System from 1987 to

		  ESRD to receive a living related renal transplant (adjusted

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burgeoning influence of managed care in
		  transplantation, coupled with a shrinking health-care
		  dollar, has placed most transplant programs under intense
		  pressure to cut costs. We undertook a retrospective
		  cost-identification analysis to determine what clinical
		  variables influenced financial outcomes after orthotopic
		  cadaver liver transplants (OLTx). METHODS: Fifty patients
		  receiving 53 transplants between April 1995 and November
		  1996 were reviewed. Clinical data were obtained from our
		  institution's transplant database, and total costs (not
		  charges) for the transplant admission and the 6 months
		  after transplant were obtained with use of an
		  activity-based cost accounting system (HBOC Trendstar,
		  Atlanta, Ga). RESULTS: The average total cost of second
		  transplants (n = 5) was \$97,262 greater than for first
		  transplants (n = 48, P \&lt; .05). Patients transplanted
		  initially as United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status
		  2 (n = 20) incurred average costs that were \$51,762 higher
		  than for patients transplanted as UNOS status 3 (n = 28, P
		  = .008). Patients with a major bacterial or fungal
		  infection (n = 28) incurred average costs \$46,282 higher
		  than recipients who were infection free (n = 22, P = .02).
		  Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only length of
		  stay, retransplantation, and postoperative dialysis were
		  significantly and independently correlated with costs (r2 =
		  .605). When the model was repeated with preoperative
		  variables alone, only UNOS status was significantly
		  correlated with 6-month total costs (P = .006, r2 = .16).
		  CONCLUSIONS: Length of stay is the most important
		  determinant of costs after OLTx. Rational strategies to
		  design cost-effective protocols after OLTx will require
		  further studies to truly define the cost of various
		  morbidities and outcomes after OLTx.}}

	Abstract = {Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998
		  purports to limit the liability of Internet service
		  providers that have been found vicariously liable for
		  copyright infringement. However, by basing this limitation
		  on the absence of the 'benefit' and 'control' elements of
		  the common law test for vicarious liability, the plain
		  language of Title II, codified at 17 U.S.C. 512, appears to
		  preclude statutory protection once a court has found a
		  service provider vicariously liable. This Comment argues
		  that courts must read a narrow definition of 'actual'
		  control into 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(1)(B) in order to preserve
		  the liability limitations of Title II, to avoid structural
		  conflict, and to fulfill legislative intent. This Comment
		  locates actual control in a line of district court cases
		  from the Second Circuit that have been eclipsed by the
		  Ninth Circuit's embrace of 'legal' control. This Comment
		  concludes that an actual-control standard best preserves
		  incentives to monitor for infringement.}}

		  for patients listed as United Network of Organ Sharing
		  (UNOS) status 1. METHODS: A total of 662 patients listed
		  (January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1995) as UNOS status
		  1 for heart transplantation by the 4 adult cardiac
		  transplant centers in an organ procurement organization
		  were analyzed in a retrospective cohort study to determine
		  differences in clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The specific
		  center at which an individual was listed as UNOS status 1
		  was a significant independent predictor of receiving a
		  transplant (odds ratios for 3 centers vs center with
		  highest likelihood = 0.73, 0.64, 0.35, respectively; P
		  \&lt;. 01). Only 1 center had a significantly increased
		  mortality rate compared with the other centers (odds ratio
		  2.03, P \&lt;.01). CONCLUSION: Within a single regional
		  organ procurement organization, cardiac transplant centers
		  demonstrate significant variability in the likelihood of
		  transplantation and survival for patients listed as UNOS
		  status 1.}}

We studied this issue by gathering data on family members of living donor allograft recipients at a single large center over a 5-year period (n = 144). By considering all potential donors (spouses and first-degree relatives) within each recipient's immediate family, we determined that men and women are excluded as donors at approximately similar rates on the basis of medical condition or known blood group type A, type B, type O incompatibility, and that a greater percentage of acceptable female donors (28.3\%) compared with men (20.3\%) go on to donate a kidney (P: = 0.027). However, when only first-degree relatives are considered, the difference in donation rate between men and women becomes nonsignificant (26.9\% of women versus 22.2\% of men; P = 0.229). Among spouses, the gender disparity in donation rate is greater (36\% of wives versus 6.5\% of husbands who are acceptable donors go on to donate a kidney; P = 0.003). Evidence that economic factors may contribute to the overall gender disparity is also presented. In conclusion, the gender disparity among living kidney donors observed in our population can be largely attributed to an overwhelming predominance of wives among spousal donors. Possible explanations and potential interventions to address underrepresentation of male donors are discussed.},

	Abstract = {This article begins with a premise that intellectual
		  property and privacy have something significant and yet
		  understated in common: both are about balancing a creator's
		  desire to control a particular set of data with consumers
		  desires to access and redistribute that data. Both law and
		  technology influence such balancing, making it more or less
		  palatable to use data for particular purposes-whether one
		  is an individual making a copy of a popular song for a
		  friend, or a hospital selling a list of maternity ward
		  patients to a day care service. In the shadow of the
		  Intetnet's vapid development and concomitant easing of
		  barriers to data sharing, holders of intellectual property
		  are pairing increased legal protection with the
		  technologies of 'trusted systems.' I describe how these
		  technologies might allow more thorough mass distribution of
		  data, while allowing publishers to retain unprecedented
		  control over their wares. For instance, an e-Book seller
		  might charge one price for a read-only copy that could not
		  be printed or forwarded and charge an additional fee for
		  each copy or printout made. Taking up the case of medical
		  privacy, I then suggest that those who worry about the
		  confidentiality of medical records, particularly as they
		  are digitized by recent congressional mandate, might seek
		  to augment comparatively paltry legal protections with
		  trusted systems technologies. For instance, a trusted
		  system could allow a patient to specify how and by whom her
		  records could be used; within limits, she could allow full
		  access to her primary care physician, while allowing only
		  time- limited access to emergency care providers,
		  non-personally identifiable access to medical researchers,
		  and no access at all for marketing purposes. These
		  technologies could allow for new kinds of privacy
		  protection, without sacrificing the legitimate interests of
		  the consumers of medical records.}}

		  is capable of explaining the potential of digital and
		  Internet technology. The ramifications of cyberspace for
		  the Oedipus complex are considered; differences between
		  simulacrum and appearance are explored to demonstrate that
		  cyberspace foretells the demise of the Oedipus complex.
		  Sigmund Freud's (1989 edition) notion of the primordial
		  father is used in conjunction with the mythical narrative
		  of Oedipus to further examine the historicity of the
		  Oedipus complex. The concept of the Third Father is
		  compared to Jacques Lacan's (3) Treatment of God as
		  nonexistent; it is subsequently asserted that the Other has
		  never existed because the Other is the symbolic order.
		  Noting the emergence of the cultural of complaint, it is
		  claimed that underprivileged individuals who complain to
		  the Other ultimately reconfirm its position. The
		  psychoanalytic conceptualization of perversion is used to
		  engage cyberspace. Despite certain scientific advancements
		  (eg, gene mapping), it is stated that cyberspace permits
		  individuals to access their fantasmatic identities that are
		  otherwise incapable of being subjectivized. It is concluded
		  that such externalization of human fantasies exemplifies
		  Lacan's notion of la traversee du fantasme (traversing
		  fantasy). 31 References. J. W. Parker}}
