@Article{	  grusky2001decomposition,
  abstract	= {{It has become fashionable to argue that stratification is
		  taking on an increasingly 'postmodern' form, as
		  participation in lifestyles or communities becomes a
		  function of individual taste, choice, and commitment rather
		  than a direct reflection of class membership. Although
		  postmodernism of this sort has become popular in some
		  circles, relevant empirical analyses are few and far
		  between and have inevitably been carried out at a highly
		  aggregate level, thereby muting or obscuring the local
		  subcultures that are generated at the more detailed
		  occupational level. The great failing, then, of
		  conventional quantitative analyses of 'class effects' is
		  that gemeinschaftlich occupations are regarded as nominal
		  categories and are therefore blithely aggregated or
		  dimensionalized. If analyses are instead ratcheted down to
		  the disaggregate level of detailed occupations, the effects
		  of class may become sufficiently strong to cast doubt on
		  the postmodernist retreat from production-based groupings.
		  The purpose of this paper is to lay out the research agenda
		  that this line of reasoning implies. We review new lines of
		  research on such core sociological topics as (a) the
		  underlying structure of social classes, (b) the
		  reproduction of inequality across generations and over the
		  lifecourse, (c) the social processes by which income
		  streams are attached to occupations, and (d) the
		  consequences of class membership for lifestyles, attitudes,
		  and consumption practices.}},

		  work to defend the importance of the concept of
		  exploitation for sociological theory. To understand the
		  foundations of Weber's class analysis one must look beyond
		  his most synoptic treatments of class in Economy and
		  Society and see how his concept of class is intimately
		  linked to his investigations of the broad problem of
		  rationalization in modern society. Class, in these terms,
		  is the way economic power is distributed when economic
		  action is organized to the greatest degree in an
		  instrumentally-rational manner. The problem of
		  exploitation-the extraction of labor effort from workers-is
		  treated, in this framework, primarily as a problem of
		  technical efficiency and economic rationality in creating
		  work incentives and effective discipline. This
		  conceptualization leads to a relatively impoverished
		  understanding of the nature of antagonistic interests
		  generated by class relations.}},
