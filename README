# Summary #

The contents of my ../texmf/bibtex/bib directory. 'socbib.bib' is a consolidated bibtex file created by merging the following files (which the repo began with but which are no longer tracked):

*	abbrevs.bib: 	Journal abbreviations.
*	altruism.bib:	Some interdisciplinary stuff on altruism.
*	book.bib:	Version of the references in Healy (2006).
*	business-networking.bib:	Tracing the emergence of network concepts in the business lit.
*	creative-industries.bib:	From a project on the Creative Economy.
*	culture.bib:	Soc of Culture.
*	culturetech.bib:	Culture and Technology.
*	data.bib:	Statistics.
*	econsoc.bib:	Economic Sociology.
*	gourmet.bib:	For a project on Rankings and Rating in Philosophy.
*	ibooks2.bib:	IT and Society.
*	internet-tech.bib:	IT and Society.
*	kieranhealy.bib:	My publications.
*	lbg-all-markedup.bib: Version of the references in Healy (2006)   
*	organsecon.bib: 	Economic sociology of blood and organ donation.
*	organsmed.bib:	    Medical literature on donation.
*	oss.bib:	Social science on Open Source Software.
*	theory.bib:	Social Theory.

So, the socbib.bib file is fairly heterogeneous. The content of the entries varies too, in that some are more complete than others. 

The bibtool-rsc folder contains some elementary resource files for conversion and bibliography normalization with the bibtool utility.
