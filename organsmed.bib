                  possibility. However, at present this shortage is
                  more acute than ever before. Post mortem kidney
                  procurement policies can be distinguished into
                  'opting in' and 'opting out' systems. In the five
                  countries cooperating in Eurotransplant, systems of
                  both kind have been implemented. In this paper the
                  relation between these procurement policies and
                  kidney availability in the Eurotransplant region is
                  examined. The opting out system turns out to be more
                  favourable to kidney procurement than the opting in
                  system. The approach of the next of kin with the
                  donation question happens to be an important barrier
                  for kidney procurement in the opting in system, but
                  fails to appear under opting out. In the epilogue
                  some remarks are made on the possibilities of
                  introduction of the opting out system in countries

                  A. Dorozynski's article in BMJ 1998;317:234, that
                  "only one other European country, Portugal, keeps
                  such a list ...". In fact, Belgium, a country that
                  approved a presumed consent law in 1986, has been
                  the first country in the world to establish in 1987
                  already an at that time unique computerized network
                  that allows citizens to register their objections
                  against (or explicit consent to) donating their
                  organs and tissues after death (1). When setting up
                  a non-donor registry in 1987, a computerized network
                  already linked all Belgian municipalities with the
                  State Registry of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,
                  containing e.g. all administrative data from each
                  individual. Citizens "able to express their will"
                  can register their objections against organ or
                  tissue donation in their local town-hall. A file
                  extract containing only the individual's will about
                  donation is downloaded on a daily base into a
                  smaller database at the Ministry of Health's
                  Information Centre. All procurement transplant
                  coordinators in Belgium have an individual password
                  protected access to this computer. Consultation of
                  this database, to check whether a referred donor had
                  objected against donation during life, is mandatory
                  before surgeons can proceed with any organ or tissue
                  removal. At the end of 1995, the cumulative
                  registered objections totaled 160,425 Belgians
                  (1.75\% of the native Belgian population) and 29,757
                  foreigners (3.23\% of the foreigners residing in
                  Belgium)(2). Apart from Belgium, non-donor
                  registries already existed also in Austria, and have
                  been established recently also in Sweden and the
                  Netherlands.}

                  after their death is being established in
                  France. Anyone not on the register will be presumed
                  to have consented to organ donation, although the
                  family will still be able to object. Set up by the
                  Etablissement Francais des Greffes, the government
                  controlled transplant watchdog group, the list will
                  enable hospitals to know immediately whether a
                  clinically dead individual had chosen not to be a
                  donor. Only one other European country, Portugal,
                  keeps such a list, with 36000 people registered as
                  non-donors. The registry is part of a campaign to
                  encourage organ donations, which have decreased in
                  recent years. In 1997, 320 patients died before a
                  transplant could be attempted, and 5302 patients
                  were on a waiting list. Yet polls have shown that
                  nearly nine out of 10 people in France are in favour
                  of organ donation, and no single factor has been
                  identified to explain the decrease, which started in
                  1991 after a highly publicised incident of a boy's
                  accidental death and the taking of his eyes without
                  specific parental authorisation. The 1992 scandal
                  about blood donations contaminated with HIV and more
                  recent rumours that organs obtained illegally had
                  been used for the benefit of wealthy foreign
                  patients, may also have contributed to the increased
                  number of refusals. In 1995, French general
                  practitioners participated in a campaign to inform
                  patients about organ donation and encourage them to
                  donate organs after their death. The current
                  campaign, and the setting up of the "refusal list,"
                  should hopefully help to increase the number of
                  donors. Anyone aged over 13 years who is willing to
                  donate organs after death is urged to inform his or
                  her relatives and to carry a donor's card. The new
                  law states that if a dead person does not have such
                  a card, the principle of "presumed consent" will
                  hold, although this should be confirmed with the
                  relatives.}

                  organ donation policies, consent rates, and number
                  of organs transplanted from patients declared "brain
                  dead" after traumatic injury in different countries
                  has not been previously reported. METHODS: An
                  international trauma survey questionnaire was
                  developed. Analysis of two responding centers with
                  regard to organ donation practices between urban,
                  free-standing adult trauma hospitals is presented:
                  the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center (STC) in
                  Baltimore, Maryland, and the Lorenz Bohler Hospital
                  (LBH) in Vienna, Austria. RESULTS: Hospital
                  admissions resulting from traumatic brain injury
                  (TBI) account for a significantly greater number of
                  admissions at the STC than at the LBH (761 vs. 276),
                  and the STC has a higher number of patients admitted
                  with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 8). Of
                  39 medically suitable brain-dead patients at the
                  STC, 18 went to organ donation. At the LBH, 16
                  patients were declared brain-dead, 7 were considered
                  to be medically suitable, and all 7 went to
                  donation. A "presumed consent" organ donation policy
                  in Austria resulted in 100\% of medically suitable
                  patients going to donation at the LBH. With a
                  volunteer donation policy at the STC, 46\% of
                  patients went to donation. Of those families who
                  refused donation at the STC, 9 of 16 eligible
                  African Americans (56\%), 10 of 21 eligible
                  Caucasians (48\%), 1 Hispanic, and 1 Native American
                  Indian family declined donation. CONCLUSION:
                  "Presumed" organ donation in Austria led to 4 organs
                  transplanted per trauma brain-death at the LBH, as
                  compared with 3.8 organs per brain-death at the
                  STC. The greater number of patients with severe TBI
                  at the STC accounts for a similar organ donation
                  rate compared with the LBH, despite the fact that
                  the consent at the STC is voluntary and at the LBH
                  is "presumed." A higher organ donation rate in the
                  United States would result in a greater number of
                  organ transplants from patients who die after
                  traumatic injury and a resultant increase in
                  potential lives saved. There does not appear to be a
                  significant difference in ethnicity between families
                  who accept and those who refuse organ donation after
                  traumatic brain death declaration at the STC.}

  abstract =	 {CONTEXT: Efforts to increase organ donation include
                  serious attempts in hospital settings, where
                  unrealized donation potential exists. Research on
                  hospital donation must include understanding
                  organizational as well as patient-specific
                  influences on the donation process. OBJECTIVE: To
                  identify organizational characteristics that
                  distinguish hospitals producing organ donations from
                  those that do not, and to estimate the number of
                  nondonor hospitals with donor potential. DESIGN:
                  Data from the American Hospital Association's 1992
                  annual survey of hospitals were matched to Organ
                  Procurement and Transplantation Network information
                  from the United Network for Organ Sharing regarding
                  the number of solid-organ donors in 1992. Hospitals
                  with donation capability were identified, based on
                  bed size and factors necessary to produce successful
                  donor maintenance and organ recovery. Based on
                  statistical analyses, organizational characteristics
                  distinguishing donor hospitals from nondonor
                  hospitals were identified. We also compared the
                  number of donors and the number of donor hospitals
                  in 1992 and 1996. SETTING: United States. RESULTS:
                  Among all hospitals affiliated with the American
                  Hospital Association (n = 5607), 1214 (22\%) were
                  identified as donor hospitals (> or = 1 donation in
                  1992). Of 2333 hospitals with procurement
                  capability, 1268 (54\%) produced no donors in
                  1992. Based on a multiple logistic regression model,
                  donor hospitals differed from nondonor hospitals by
                  hospital ownership, with municipally owned hospitals
                  more likely and federally owned hospitals less
                  likely to produce donation, compared with for-profit
                  and not-for-profit hospitals. Other organizational
                  characteristics associated with donor hospitals were
                  level of trauma services, whether the hospital had a
                  transplant surgery program or a hospital ethics
                  committee, and whether it was located in the South
                  Atlantic, Southwest Central, or Pacific regions of
                  the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitals not
                  currently producing organ donations, there is a
                  sizable subgroup with donor potential. This area
                  merits further attention.}

                  the impact of the zonal allocation system for
                  thoracic organs on the outcome of our transplant
                  activity. METHODS: We analyzed the results of
                  thoracic transplants performed between 1987 and
                  1998. The transplants were divided into 3 groups:
                  local donors retrieved by our team (171 hearts and
                  61 lungs; DL group); distant donors retrieved by our
                  team (58 hearts and 35 lungs; DD group); and distant
                  donors retrieved by other teams (51 hearts and 41
                  lungs; DX group). RESULTS: No significant
                  differences were observed among the groups in early
                  postoperative events for either heart or lung
                  transplantation. Heart transplants: Cardiac index
                  was 2.6 +/- 0.4 L/m(2) for the DL group, 2.7 +/- 0.6
                  L/m(2) for the DD group, and 2.5 +/- 0.7 L/m(2) for
                  the DX group (P =.4). The 30-day mortalities were
                  9.1\%, 9.1\%, and 8.3\% ( P =.5) and the 1-year
                  survivals 83\%, 80\%, and 82\% ( P =.4) for the DL,
                  DD, and DX groups, respectively. Lung transplants:
                  Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was 358 +/- 19 mm
                  Hg for the DL group, 345 +/- 17 mm Hg for the DD
                  group, and 329 +/- 21 mm Hg for the DX group (P
                  =.07). The 30-day mortalities were 9.9\%, 10.5\%,
                  and 12.8\% (P =.2) and the 1-year survivals 79\%,
                  75\%, and 77\% (P =.3) for the DL, DD, and DX
                  groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Zonal allocation
                  for thoracic organs has been successfully applied to
                  our program. Using donor organs retrieved by other
                  teams, we have achieved equivalent outcomes for both
                  heart and lung transplantation.},

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Shortage of liver donors means that new
                  methods of liver procurement must be explored. In
                  domino transplantation, organs explanted during
                  transplantation in one patient are transplanted into
                  a second patient. Domino procedures can be performed
                  with livers from patients having transplantation for
                  hepatic metabolic disorders that cause systemic
                  disease without affecting other liver
                  functions. Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP)
                  type I is one of these. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed
                  the Paul Brousse experience with a domino liver
                  transplant program for FAP, hoping to extend the
                  approach to other metabolic disorders. RESULTS:
                  Livers from 10 patients transplanted for FAP type 1
                  were used for domino transplants to patients with
                  unresectable primary or metastatic liver
                  cancers. There was no perioperative
                  mortality. Neuropathy or cardiomyopathy did not
                  increase the morbidity of the domino liver explant
                  and transplant procedures. Morbidity for the domino
                  recipients did not appear to be increased. Variant
                  transthyretin was detected in the serum in FAP liver
                  recipients, with no immediate clinical
                  consequences. CONCLUSIONS: The domino approach is
                  feasible and requires careful planning of the
                  surgical procedures for liver explantation,
                  particularly for the nature and site of vascular
                  anastomoses. Domino transplantation of metabolically
                  dysfunctional livers creates new categories of
                  potential donors and potential recipients. It raises
                  new ethical, technical, and societal issues. The
                  domino approach could be used in several genetic or
                  biochemical disorders now treated by liver
                  transplantation. It has the potential to increase
                  the number of liver grafts available for
                  transplantation.},

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Living related liver transplantation has
                  been developed as an important potential source of
                  organs for treatment of children with acute and
                  chronic liver disease. A single UK centre performing
                  living related liver transplantation was established
                  in 1993. METHODS: Parents who were potential donors
                  for their children for living related liver
                  transplantation were assessed for suitability
                  according to a protocol based on one developed and
                  published by the University of Chicago Transplant
                  Group. Records kept by the transplant coordinators
                  were retrieved and data were extracted. RESULTS: Of
                  64 potential donors for 32 potential recipients ten
                  were excluded at a preliminary stage. Fourteen
                  ultimately became donors. Of 54 parents who began
                  evaluation 23 were finally considered to be
                  suitable. There were 19 non-disease-related reasons
                  for unsuitability: blood group mismatch (eight
                  cases), size discrepancy (six), pregnancy (two),
                  oral contraceptive medication (one), vascular
                  anatomy variant (one) and age (one). Sixteen were
                  unsuitable because disease was found, namely fatty
                  liver (four), thyroid disease (two), hepatitis B
                  positivity (two), cardiac murmur (one), anaemia
                  (one), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
                  (one), diabetes mellitus (one) and psychological
                  problems (one), and three parents were affected by
                  the same disorder as the child (Alagille syndrome,
                  one; mitochondrial disorder, one; recurrent
                  cholestasis, one). Three parents were rejected for
                  more than one reason. Both parents were unsuitable
                  for donation in 21 per cent of cases. CONCLUSION:
                  Parents approach living related liver
                  transplantation with enthusiasm. They should be
                  advised of the high chance of unsuitability,
                  including the finding of significant pathology. The
                  limitation of living related liver transplantation
                  as the major source of organs for children is
                  recognized.},

  medlineref =	 {99302228},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation is the treatment
                  of choice for patients with end-stage organ failure,
                  but the supply of organs has not increased to meet
                  demand. This study was undertaken to determine the
                  potential for kidney donation from patients with
                  irremediable brain injuries who do not meet the
                  criteria for brain death and who experience
                  cardiopulmonary arrest after withdrawal of
                  ventilatory support (controlled non-heart-beating
                  organ donors). METHODS: The charts of 209 patients
                  who died during 1995 in the Emergency Department and
                  the intensive care unit at the Foothills Hospital in
                  Calgary were reviewed. The records of patients who
                  met the criteria for controlled non-heart-beating
                  organ donation were studied in detail. The main
                  outcome measure was the time from discontinuation of
                  ventilation until cardiopulmonary arrest. RESULTS:
                  Seventeen potential controlled non-heart-beating
                  organ donors were identified. Their mean age was 62
                  (standard deviation 19) years. Twelve of the
                  patients (71\%) had had a cerebrovascular accident,
                  and more than half (10 [59\%]) did not meet the
                  criteria for brain death because one or more brain
                  stem reflexes were present. At the time of
                  withdrawal of ventilatory support, the mean serum
                  creatinine level was 71 (29) mumol/L, mean urine
                  output was 214 (178) mL/h, and 9 (53\%) patients
                  were receiving inotropic agents. The mean time from
                  withdrawal of ventilatory support to cardiac arrest
                  was 2.3 (5.0) hours; 13 of the 17 patients died
                  within 1 hour, and all but one died within 6
                  hours. For the year for which charts were reviewed,
                  33 potential conventional donors (people whose
                  hearts were beating) were identified, of whom 21
                  (64\%) became donors. On the assumption that 40\% of
                  the potential controlled non-heart-beating donors
                  would not in fact have been donors (25\% because of
                  family refusal and 15\% because of nonviability of
                  the organs), there might have been 10 additional
                  donors, which would have increased the supply of
                  cadaveric kidneys for transplantation by
                  48\%. INTERPRETATION: A significant number of viable
                  kidneys could be retrieved and transplanted if
                  eligibility for kidney donation was extended to
                  include controlled non-heart-beating organ donors.},

                  of organ recovery.},
  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: With the exception of primary central
                  nervous system tumors, organ recovery is no longer
                  considered from donors with known
                  malignancy. Because intrathoracic and intraabdominal
                  organs are usually recovered before the kidneys, we
                  examined the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in
                  cadaveric donor kidneys at the time of organ
                  recovery. This would establish the theoretical risk
                  of transplanting donor organs from a patient with a
                  known renal malignancy. METHODS: In cooperation with
                  the Louisiana Organ Procurement Agency, we reviewed
                  the records of all patients who were cadaveric
                  kidney donors in the state of Louisiana between
                  September 1991 and October 1997. Information was
                  reviewed and analyzed on donor age, sex, race, past
                  medical/surgical history, cause of death, and the
                  findings at the time of organ recovery. RESULTS: A
                  total of 553 consecutive cadaveric donors were
                  identified, with 1106 kidneys recovered. Of the 553
                  cadaveric donors, 5 (0.9\%) were noted to have an
                  incidental renal cell carcinoma. All tumors were
                  identified in separate donors; that is, none of the
                  tumors were bilateral. None of the five donors had
                  documented symptoms referable to their urinary
                  tract. All tumors were either T1 or T2 by the tumor,
                  node, metastasis classification system, and no
                  evidence of nodal or distant metastatic disease was
                  present. In one case, the contralateral kidney,
                  heart, and liver were transplanted before the tumor
                  was identified. In the remaining four cases, all
                  organs (renal and nonrenal) were
                  discarded. CONCLUSIONS: Renal cell carcinoma is
                  rarely found during renal recovery from a cadaveric
                  donor. However, because the kidneys are usually
                  recovered after the intrathoracic and intraabdominal
                  organs, careful palpation of the kidneys and
                  exploration of any abnormalities is mandated to
                  avoid transplanting any organs from a donor with a
                  known renal malignancy.},

                  waiting time of kidney transplant candidates and to
                  increase the graft pool. Live donor renal
                  transplants have demonstrated better results in term

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: A novel plan of renal allograft
                  allocation has been conducted by United Network for
                  Organ Sharing Region 1 transplant centers since
                  September 3, 1996, based upon HLA matching, time
                  waiting, and population distance points. The
                  objectives of this plan were to achieve a balance
                  between increasing the opportunity of renal
                  transplantation for those patients listed with long
                  waiting times and promoting local organ donor
                  availability. METHODS: A single list of candidates
                  was formulated for each cadaver donor, assigning a
                  maximum of 8 points for time waiting, a maximum of 8
                  points for population distance from the donor
                  hospital, and HLA points based upon the degree of
                  B/DR mismatch. Additional points were awarded to a
                  cross-match-negative patient with a panel-reactive
                  antibody of \&gt;80\%, and to pediatric
                  patients. RESULTS: The total number of kidneys
                  transplanted to patients who had waited \&gt;3 years
                  was 100 (46\%), and to patients who had waited
                  \&gt;2.5-3 years was 29 (13\%). However, the total
                  number of kidneys transplanted to patients with the
                  maximum population distance points was only 72
                  (33\%). Thus, although the plan achieved a favorable
                  distribution of kidneys to patients with longer
                  waiting times (nearly 60\%), the other, equally
                  important objective of promoting local donor
                  availability was not initially
                  accomplished. Moreover, minor HLA B/DR differences
                  between the donor and the recipient (i.e., not
                  phenotypically matched) were unexpectedly
                  consequential in determining allocation. As a result
                  of these observations, the following adjustments
                  were made in the plan (as of December 3, 1997): a
                  maximum of 10 points for population distance, a
                  maximum of 8 points for time waiting (both by a
                  linear correlation), and the retention of HLA points
                  for 0 B/DR mismatch only. After these interval
                  changes, the percentage of patients receiving a
                  kidney with some population distance points
                  increased from 85\% to 96\%. Conclusions. We have
                  shown that a heterogeneous region of multiple
                  transplant centers can devise (and modify) an
                  innovative and balanced plan that provides an
                  equitable system of allocation for an
                  ever-increasing number of patients.},

  abstract =	 {OBJECTIVE: Non-heart-beating organ donation for
                  transplantation is increasing despite the concern
                  whether all the donors are dead. This concern is
                  based on the adequacy of documentation of death and
                  the appropriate duration that circulation and
                  respiration should be absent before death
                  certification. No studies have examined the
                  documentation and deaths of patients who became
                  non-heart-beating organ donors. DESIGN:
                  Retrospective study of observational data. PATIENTS:
                  All non-brain-dead patients who became
                  non-heart-beating organ donors at the University of
                  Pittsburgh Medical Center from January 1, 1993, to
                  June 30, 1998, were identified. Records for 15 of 16
                  patients were available for review. MEASUREMENTS AND
                  MAIN RESULTS: Adequacy of documentation, extubation
                  time, onset of severe hypotension, duration of
                  absent circulation before death was certified, and
                  the time of incision for organ procurement were
                  ascertained. Twelve of 15 records had all required
                  clinical documentation. The mean age of patients was
                  46.5 +/- 5.7 yrs. All 15 patients were extubated
                  before death and had femoral arterial catheters; one
                  had a biventricular assist device discontinued. The
                  time of hypotension and pulselessness was not
                  documented for one and three patients,
                  respectively. All 12 patients with documentation had
                  \&gt; or =2 mins of absent circulation. Time from
                  certification to incision for procurement was 1.1
                  +/- 2.3 mins. CONCLUSIONS: In a small study of
                  non-heart-beating organ donation, circulation never
                  resumed after \&gt;1 min of absent circulation,
                  suggesting that 2 mins of absent circulation is
                  sufficient to certify death. Three of 15 patients
                  had inadequate documentation. Gaps and
                  inconsistencies in documentation may raise concern
                  about the potential for abuse.},

                  marrow (BM) and 52 cytokine-mobilized peripheral

                  of Meg-CFC with the total number of CFC and mixed
                  cell-CFC was also assessed. The frequency of Meg-CFC
                  was highest in CB and correlated significantly with
                  total CFC numbers (mean 20.8\%, correlation
                  coefficient (r) 0.84, P = 0.0001) compared with
                  Meg-CFC from mobilized PB (mean 13.1\%, r = 0.29, P
                  = 0.07) and BM (mean 4\%, r = 0. 39, P = 0.13). In
                  addition, mixed-cell CFC numbers in CB were highly
                  correlated with the total number of Meg-CFC (r =
                  0.7, P = 0.0001). No such correlations were found
                  with mobilized PB or BM. We conclude that, based on
                  the high degree of correlation between Meg-CFC and
                  non-Meg-CFC numbers in CB, no additional information
                  concerning time to platelet engraftment would be
                  gained by routinely performing Meg-CFC assays in
                  addition to non-Meg-CFC assays. The fact that CB
                  Meg-CFC and mixed-cell CFC are strongly correlated
                  suggests that CB Meg-CFC are more primitive than
                  their counterparts in BM and PB and may reflect the

                  who are bacteremic is controversial. We examined the
                  outcome of recipients of solid organs from donors
                  with bacteremia and/or fungemia at the time of organ
                  recovery. METHODS: All organ donors from a single
                  organ procurement organization between January 1990
                  and December 1996 were retrospectively analyzed. We
                  calculated rates of transmission from bacteremic or
                  fungemic donors to their recipients and compared the
                  graft and patient survival rates for recipients of
                  these organs with those for recipients of organs
                  from non-bacteremic donors. RESULTS: There were 95
                  (5.1\%) bacteremic donors from a total of 1775, from
                  whom 212 recipients received organs. Forty-six
                  (48\%) of the bacteremic donors had pathogens in
                  their blood. Among the 101 recipients of organs from
                  these, no evidence of transmission could be
                  documented. (0\% transmission rate, 95\% CI
                  0-3). The remaining 49 donors had either
                  Staphylococcus epidermidis or other unlikely
                  pathogens recovered from the blood. Examination of
                  the 111 recipients of organs from these donors also
                  found no evidence for transmission (0\% transmission
                  rate, 95\% CI 0-3). Of the 212 recipients, 193
                  (91\%) received a mean of 3.8+/-2.5 days of
                  antibiotics postoperatively. The 30-day graft and
                  patient survival for recipients of organs from
                  bacteremic donors was not significantly different
                  from recipients of organs from nonbacteremic donors
                  (P = 0.695 for patient survival, and P = 0.310 for
                  graft survival). CONCLUSIONS: Organs transplanted
                  from bacteremic donors do not transmit bacterial
                  infection or result in poorer outcomes. Use of
                  organs from these donors could help increase organ

  abstract =	 {Offering the option of organ and tissue donation to
                  grieving families may seem stressful, but asking the
                  question may provide a positive means to extend care
                  to the bereaved family and help others in
                  return. Many donor families have said donation was
                  an opportunity to make some sense out of a senseless
                  situation and to relieve some of the grief they
                  experienced. This article presents a case that
                  started with such a discussion by ICU nurses in one
                  of our donor hospitals, and ended with successful
                  organ and tissue recovery and transplantation. As
                  \&quot;routine\&quot; as this may sound, it was
                  anything but routine--it made history.},

  abstract =	 {PURPOSE: To report and discuss cases of lamellar
                  keratoplasty using corneas obtained during previous
                  penetrating keratoplasty in keratoconus
                  eyes. METHODS: Corneal buttons were obtained from 7
                  keratoconus patients and stored in a preserving
                  solution for 7-60 days (average, 32.4 days) before
                  use. The recipient eyes comprised recurrent
                  pterygium 3 eyes, primary pterygium 1 eye,
                  pseudopterygium 1 eye, corneal perforation with iris
                  prolapse due to fungal corneal ulcer 1 eye, and
                  limbal dermoid 1 eye. RESULTS: The recipient eyes
                  ran favorable courses in general. Graft rejection
                  developed in 2 eyes and was successfully treated
                  with topical and systemic
                  corticosteroid. CONCLUSIONS: Preserved corneas from
                  keratoconus eyes were found useful in therapeutic
                  lamellar keratoplasty. By this procedure, the
                  current inadequate supply of donor corneas in eye
                  banks in Japan can be augmented.},

  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {OBJECTIVES: This study examined whether patients'
                  race was associated with their families' being
                  approached for organ donation and agreeing to
                  donation. METHODS: Logistic regression models were
                  applied to data collected from records at 112
                  hospitals. RESULTS: The odds that a family of a
                  White patient was approached for donation were
                  nearly twice those for a family of an African
                  American. The odds of donation also differed by
                  race, but the magnitude varied by patient and
                  hospital characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Much
                  attention directed toward racial disparity in
                  donation has focused on attitudes of the public. The
                  behavior of hospital staff also may be related to
                  differences in rates.},

                  banking and distribution of cryopreserved heart
                  valves has been carried out at the European
                  Homograft Bank (EHB) in Brussels without
                  interruption since January 1989. We present an
                  assessment of the Bank's activities during this
                  10-year period. METHODS: Heart valve donors aged
                  \&lt;62 years form three categories: multiorgan
                  donors with non-transplantable hearts; recipients of
                  cardiac transplantation; and non-beating heart
                  cadavers with a warm ischemia time of less than 6
                  h. Past history and biology are checked for
                  transmissible diseases. Dissection, incubation in
                  antibiotics and cryopreservation in 10\%
                  dimethylsulfoxide with storage in liquid nitrogen
                  vapors (about -150 degrees C), and quality control
                  are according to the standards of the Belgian
                  Ministry of Health. Cryopreserved valves are shipped
                  to the implantation centers in a dry shipper at
                  about -150 degrees C. RESULTS: Between January 30th
                  1989 and December 31st 1998, 1,817
                  non-transplantable hearts and 12 excised semilunar
                  valves were obtained. In total, 2,077 valves (1,032
                  pulmonary, 931 aortic and 13 mitral) were
                  decontaminated, cryopreserved and stored in liquid
                  nitrogen vapor (six more valves were
                  refrigerated). In total, 1,515 valves were discarded
                  at different stages of the protocol, the main causes
                  of rejection being significant macroscopic lesions
                  (68.2\% aortic and 26.67\% pulmonary). Inadequate
                  excision at procurement (10.37\% pulmonary),
                  persistent contamination after antibiotics (5.6\%)
                  and positive serology for hepatitis B and C and Q
                  fever (5.4\%) were other frequent causes for
                  rejection. Among the 2,117 accepted valves, 1,398
                  were graded first and 719 second choice, mainly on
                  the basis of morphology. In total, 2,090
                  cryopreserved valves and one refrigerated valve were
                  implanted in 39 institutions between May 1989 and
                  December 1998. Of requests, 10.02\% could not be
                  satisfied. In total, 967 pulmonary valves were
                  implanted in the right ventricular outflow tract
                  (RVOT); 424 during a Ross procedure, and 76 in the
                  left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Of the aortic
                  valves, 732 were implanted in the LVOT and 266 in
                  the RVOT. Mitral homografts were used for tricuspid
                  valve replacement in two cases, and in the mitral
                  position in seven. Complications at distribution and
                  thawing included 10 bag ruptures and 16 transversal
                  conduit wall fractures. Of the valves shipped, 317
                  (13.16\%) were not used and were returned safely in
                  the dry shipper. Comparison of distribution rates in
                  the first 5.5 and last 4.5 years of EHB activity
                  shows: (i) a significant increase in pulmonary valve
                  implantations in the RVOT (from 71.95\% to 81.95\%);
                  and (ii) a marked increase (265\%) in pulmonary
                  homograft implantations as part of a Ross operation,
                  and a significant decrease (28\%) in aortic
                  homograft implantation in the LVOT. CONCLUSION:
                  While macroscopic lesions of procured aortic valves
                  remain the most frequent and unavoidable cause of
                  homograft rejection during quality control, the high
                  percentage of inadequate surgical heart valve
                  excision should be corrected. The rates of bacterial
                  contamination and positive serology seem
                  acceptable. Storage and shipping of cryopreserved
                  homografts in liquid nitrogen vapor permits them to
                  be spared very efficiently. The increasing use of
                  pulmonary valves for RVOT reconstruction either in
                  congenital heart disease or as part of the Ross
                  procedure compensates for the limited availability
                  of good quality aortic valves.},

                  (LT) and waiting time for surgery is increasing. In
                  Australia, LT rates are 4. 6/million population/yr,
                  which despite low organ donation rates, are the
                  highest published in the world. The Australian organ
                  allocation system allows identification of marginal
                  donors and therapeutic manipulation where
                  appropriate. This study aims to assess the impact of
                  utilization of marginal donors and aggressive donor
                  management. A comparison between published donor
                  criteria and local practice is made, allowing
                  assessment of the effect of using marginal donors on
                  outcome. Donor management included antibiotic
                  therapy, strict fluid management, physiotherapy,
                  bronchoscopy and bronchial toilet, and alteration of
                  ventilatory settings including initiation of
                  pressure support. Blood gases were repeated to
                  assess the results of interventions. Between January
                  1, 1995 and May 31, 1998, we performed 140
                  transplants from 112 of 219 (51\%) lung donor
                  offers. Of these donors, 48 (43\%) satisfied all
                  published criteria for suitable donor organs (Group
                  1 = ideal donors) and 64 (57\%) did not (Group 2 =
                  marginal donors). Criteria breached by the marginal
                  donors were: an initial ratio of arterial oxygen
                  pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2)

                  smoking (n = 5) and age \&gt; 55 yr (n =
                  4). Therapeutic manipulation resulted in improvement
                  in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio in 20 donors (Group 3) who
                  would not otherwise have been used. Immediate and 24
                  h postoperative gas exchange and length of intensive
                  care unit (ICU) stay was not different for
                  recipients from donors from all three
                  groups. Overall survival was 94\% at 30 d, 83\% at 1
                  yr, 70\% at 2 yr, and 62\% at 3 yr and was not
                  significantly different from the three groups. We
                  conclude that organ utilization can be maximized by
                  therapeutic manipulation and utilization of marginal
                  donors without compromising results from
                  transplantation.},

  abstract =	 {OBJECTIVE: To develop organ donor indices to assess
                  donor rates of individual hospitals. DESIGN: Data
                  from hospital databases were retrospectively
                  reviewed for patient separation ICD-9-CM codes
                  (i.e., diagnostic codes from the International
                  classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical
                  modification) to identify and categories actual and
                  potential organ donors. Organ donor indices for
                  groups of codes and for individual hospitals were
                  determined by dividing the number of actual donors
                  by the total number of patients who died with the
                  same separation ICD-9-CM codes. SETTING: The three
                  South Australian adult tertiary hospitals in
                  1988-1995. PATIENTS: The 154 actual organ donors,
                  and all patients aged less than 71 years who died
                  with the same groups of ICD-9-CM codes as the organ
                  donors. RESULTS: Organ donors could be classified by
                  three groups of ICD-9-CM codes specifying diseases
                  or pathological processes that could result in brain
                  death. These groups were head injury (44.2\% of
                  donors), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (42.2\%),
                  and eight \&quot;other\&quot; codes
                  (13.6\%). Differences between the head injury donor
                  indices for the three hospitals were not significant
                  (Hospital A, 19.1\%; Hospital B, 24\%; Hospital C,
                  21\%), but there were significant interhospital
                  differences in donor indices for the CVA group (A,
                  11.2\%; B, 5.7\%; C, 5.1\%; P \&lt; 0.05) and the
                  \&quot;other\&quot; group (A, 3.6\%; B, 0.7\%; C,
                  0.3\%; P \&lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9-CM codes
                  can be used to describe organ donors and hospital
                  populations from which potential organ donors may be
                  found. The casemix-controlled organ donor indices
                  can be used to compare the organ donor rates of
                  individual hospitals and to examine reasons for low
                  rates (other than purely casemix variation).},

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B surface antigenemia (HBsAg)
                  has been considered at least a relative
                  contraindication for heart transplantation, yet
                  patients have undergone liver transplantation for
                  hepatitis B-induced chronic liver disease, albeit
                  with poorer results than for other liver
                  diseases. The impact of asymptomatic hepatitis B
                  infection on heart transplant outcome is not
                  known. METHODS: To examine this question, we queried
                  the Joint International Society for Heart and Lung
                  Transplantation/United Network of Organ Sharing
                  Thoracic Registry for all patients undergoing heart
                  transplantation who had been identified as positive
                  for HBsAg before transplantation. We then sent a
                  4-question data instrument to the centers
                  responsible for the identified
                  patients. Seventy-eight patients were identified. Of
                  the 78 data forms sent, 53 forms were returned with
                  the requested data. Of the 53 data forms returned,
                  the centers incorrectly identified 23 patients as
                  positive for HBsAg, resulting in 30 patients who
                  were confirmed as HBsAg positive and who served as
                  the final cohort for this analysis. RESULTS: The
                  cohort included 24 males and 6 females, with a mean
                  age of 46 +/- 16 years (range 0 to 68 years). Eleven
                  patients had coronary artery disease, 14 had dilated
                  cardiomyopathy, and 5 patients had a variety of
                  other cardiac diseases. Of those tested at most
                  recent follow-up, 20 of 25 patients continued to be
                  positive for HBsAg, whereas 7 of 21 patients studied
                  had converted and were hepatitis B serum
                  antibody-positive. Approximately 37\% of the
                  patients had evidence of active hepatic inflammation
                  or cirrhosis. We found a statistically significant
                  correlation between positivity for hepatitis C
                  antibodies and clinical liver disease (p =
                  0.0105). No difference in survival could be
                  demonstrated between the study cohort and a
                  reference heart transplant cohort, yet 5 of the 9
                  deaths were considered to be related to hepatitis
                  B. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that clinical
                  liver disease is common post-transplantation in
                  HBsAg+ patients who presumably have no overt liver
                  disease at the time of transplantation. Despite the
                  inability to show a survival difference in this
                  cohort, the fact that the majority of deaths were
                  related to hepatitis B should suggest caution in
                  accepting HBsAg+ patients for cardiac
                  transplantation.},

  Title =	 {Outcomes of penetrating keratoplasty with imported

  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {PURPOSE: To analyze factors influencing the surgical
                  success of penetrating keratoplasty and long-term
                  graft survival when using imported donor
                  corneas. METHODS: Sixty-three donor corneas imported
                  to Taipei from the Cincinnati Eye Bank from July
                  1992-June 1993 were used for penetrating
                  keratoplasty. The corneal endothelium was examined
                  using specular microscopy on arrival in Taiwan. The
                  endothelial morphology and endothelial cell density
                  (ECD) were compared with the photograph of the same
                  cornea taken in the United States. The relationships
                  of the surgical success rate with donor age, death
                  to enucleation time, death to surgery time, and ECD
                  were analyzed. The long-term graft survival and ECD
                  of clear grafts were analyzed 4 years after
                  surgery. RESULTS: On specular microscopic
                  examination. the imported corneas showed diminished
                  endothelial reflection, blurred cellular borders,
                  and increased dark areas, which were markedly
                  different from the pictures of the corneal
                  endothelium taken in the United States. The average
                  ECD before transportation was 2,525+/-267/mm2 and
                  decreased to 1,934+/-250/mm2 after transportation (p
                  \&lt; 0.001), with an average endothelial cell loss
                  of 590+/-247/mm2. The overall surgical success rate
                  was 89\% and did not correlate with any of the donor
                  factors tested except death to surgery time. The
                  surgical success rate decreased when the time from
                  death to surgery was \&gt;7 days (p = 0.05), mainly
                  because of poor reepithelialization. Four years
                  after surgery, 24 grafts remained clear. The ECD had
                  decreased by 72+/-5\% in the clear
                  grafts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that
                  endothelial changes in imported donor corneas do
                  occur after transportation, but the surgical success
                  rate may not be influenced significantly if the
                  penetrating keratoplasty is performed within 7 days
                  after donor death. However, the ECD in the clear
                  grafts 4 years after surgery is low.},

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Our organ procurement organization has
                  been forced to liberalize the donor criteria in
                  order to expand the donor pool for pancreas
                  transplantation. In this report, we describe our
                  experience using whole organ pancreatic grafts from
                  \&quot;marginal\&quot; donors, which include grafts
                  obtained from donors over 45 years of age and from
                  donors who were identified to be hemodynamically
                  unstable at the time of organ retrieval. METHODS: A
                  prospective study was performed between July 1994
                  and March 1998, during which time 137 pancreas
                  transplants were performed at our center using
                  organs procured by our own surgeons (organs sent by
                  other teams were excluded). The rapid en bloc
                  technique was used exclusively. The use of
                  pancreatic grafts from marginal donors was analyzed
                  for short-term and overall graft survival, and for
                  delayed graft function and complications. RESULTS:
                  Overall pancreas graft survival for our series was
                  83\%, with a mean follow-up of 23 months. There were
                  22 pancreas grafts from donors over 45 years of age,
                  13 of whom were greater than 50 years of age. The
                  actual graft survival rate of the over-45 donor
                  group was 86\%. Fifty-one grafts were removed from
                  hemodynamically unstable donors on high-dose
                  vasopressors. The actual graft survival in this
                  group was 86\%. There was no significant difference
                  found in graft survival between recipients of
                  pancreatic grafts from marginal and nonmarginal
                  donors. Delayed graft function was exhibited by more
                  recipients of grafts from donors on high-dose
                  vasopressors (P\&lt;0.05), but this had no effect on
                  long-term graft survival and endocrine
                  function. Recipients of marginal donor grafts did
                  not have higher rates of complication compared to
                  recipients of nonmarginal grafts. CONCLUSIONS: Based
                  on our results, we currently employ a graft
                  selection strategy not limited by donor age or
                  hemodynamic stability. Our selection of pancreas
                  organs for transplantation is based on careful
                  inspection of the pancreas and determination of the
                  adequacy of the ex vivo flush. Our results suggest
                  that the current pancreas donor pool may be expanded
                  substantially.},

  abstract =	 {Both family consent and legal consent were required
                  for organ/tissue donation from non-heart-beating
                  donors (NHBD) in Taiwan. A district attorney had to
                  come to the bedside to confirm the donor's asystole,
                  confirm the family consent, and complete some legal
                  documents before a legal consent was issued for
                  organ donation. The resultant warm ischemic time
                  would be unpredictably long and in fact precluded
                  the organ donation from NHBD in Taiwan. We developed
                  a method of using extracorporeal membrane
                  oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain NHBD for a longer
                  time and prevent warm ischemic injury of the donor
                  abdominal organs. After ventilator disconnection in
                  NHBD, phentolamine and heparin were injected and
                  mannitol infusion was given. After the donor's
                  asystole was confirmed by the electrocardiogram
                  (EKG) strip recording, the ECMO support was set up
                  through the right femoral veno-arterial route, an
                  occlusion balloon catheter was inserted through the
                  left femoral artery to occlude the thoracic aorta,
                  and bilateral femoral arteries were
                  ligated. Usually, the ECMO could begin within 10 min
                  after the donor's asystole. The ECMO, combined with
                  a cooler, provided cold oxygenated blood to the
                  abdominal visceral organs, and prevented their warm
                  ischemic injuries. Under the ECMO support (range:
                  45-70 min), eight renal grafts were procured from 4
                  NHBD. With the exception of the first two renal
                  grafts with delayed function, all others had
                  immediate function postoperatively and dialysis was
                  no longer needed. In conclusion, by our ECMO
                  technique, NHBD could be maintained for a longer
                  time and the renal grafts had better immediate
                  postoperative function than those reported by other
                  methods.},

                  analysis of procurement in a neurosurgical unit and
                  review of press reports.},
  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was undertaken to
                  determine the number of potential organ donors in a
                  neurosurgical intensive care unit and to record the
                  actual number of organ donations. The reasons for
                  refusal of organ donations were analysed with
                  respect to the controversial public discussion of
                  the brain death concept and the transplantation law
                  in Germany. METHODS: From 1994 to 1997, the number
                  of cases of brain death, and the number of cases in
                  which relatives consented or refused to organ
                  donation as well as the number of actual organ
                  explantations was recorded. Over the same period,
                  press reports of 5 German language newspapers were
                  analysed with regard to the authors' position on
                  brain death and transplantation law, their
                  qualification, intention, and mode of
                  presentation. RESULTS: Annually, about 70 deaths
                  occurred on the department's intensive care unit of
                  which almost 30\% of the patients were determined to
                  have suffered brain death without any obvious
                  contraindications against organ donation. The
                  refusal rate of relatives rose from 56\% up to 78\%,
                  and the rate of organ donors thus decreased from 5\%
                  in 1994 to 4\% presently in the department. About
                  100 reports were published each year in the analysed
                  newspapers, of which about 90\% voiced approval of
                  organ transplantation. During the review period, the
                  depiction became more objective (57\% in 1994 to
                  82\% in 1997) and the suspicious attitude toward the
                  technique of brain death diagnosis declined. Whereas
                  50\% of the articles rejected the brain death
                  concept in 1994, this figure decreased to 39\% in
                  1997 and conversely the concept of consent rose from
                  33\% in 1994 to 56\% in 1997. CONCLUSION: In
                  Germany, the relatives refusal rate in organ
                  donation is continuously high, presumable due to a
                  depressing 39\% of press reports rejecting the brain
                  death concept, and resulting in a very low number of
                  organ donations. There is hope that the
                  transplantation law which has finally passed German
                  parliament in 1997, confirming the brain death
                  concept as well as the legal principle of prior
                  consent by the donor or consent by the relatives
                  will eventually result in an increase of organ
                  donation especially when supported by an educational
                  campaign which is embodied in the transplantation
                  law.},

                  transplantation: use of marginal donors.},
  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {PURPOSE: In a living related transplantation program
                  it is not always possible to find an ideal
                  donor. Sometimes the only available donor in the
                  family has some benign disease or suboptimal renal
                  anatomy or physiology, or is too old to be accepted
                  and defined as a marginal donor. However, with
                  proper screening the donor pool can be increased by
                  accepting these marginal donors and treating the
                  benign diseases which is beneficial to the donor. We
                  evaluate the outcome of grafts from marginal
                  donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 1988 to
                  August 1997, 581 live related transplantations were
                  performed. Of the donors 52 were older than 60 years
                  and 34 had associated benign renal or nonrenal
                  anomaly or disease. These donors were accepted after
                  thorough questioning and consultation with family
                  members. The recipients of graft from elderly donors
                  were evaluated for the number of rejections, serum
                  creatinine at last followup and graft
                  survival. RESULTS: Of the recipients 52 received
                  grafts from elderly donors with a mean age of
                  62.6+/-3.7 years. Mean followup was 34.14+/-0.7
                  months. The 2 and 5-year actuarial graft survival
                  was 96\% and 74\%, respectively. Creatinine was
                  normal (less than 1.5) in 37\% of recipients and 1.5
                  to 2.5 mg.\% in 46\%. The rejection rate in
                  postoperative month 1 was 29\%. All donors underwent
                  simultaneous surgery to treat the benign disease,
                  and all did well after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: By
                  accepting these marginal donors a 14.6\% increase in
                  the living related donor pool was achieved without
                  compromising recipient or donor safety. Otherwise
                  these recipients would have been forced to undergo
                  unrelated transplantation or be maintained on
                  dialysis, which is particularly difficult in a
                  developing country. Donors with associated disease
                  benefited from cure.},

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Among the main causes for the relatively
                  small number of organ donors, the delay in the
                  diagnosis of brain death plays a major
                  role. Administration of drugs causing central
                  nervous system (CNS) depression prevents diagnosis
                  of brain death by clinical and
                  electroencephalographic criteria until serum
                  clearance of the drug has occurred. Confirming brain
                  death by demonstrating persistent intracranial
                  circulatory arrest might decrease the length of the
                  diagnostic process. We have carried out a
                  prospective study to investigate whether 99
                  mTc-hexamethyl propylenamino oxime (99mTc-HMPAO)
                  brain scintigraphy and/or transcranial Doppler
                  ultrasound can speed up the diagnosis of brain death
                  in patients treated with CNS depressant
                  drugs. METHODS: All 138 consecutive patients with
                  severe brain lesion that progressed to brain death
                  in our center between January 1994 and December 1996
                  were controlled. Of them, 36 patients aged 1 to 65
                  years old (mean=25.6+/-18.3 years) who met clinical
                  and EEG criteria for the diagnosis of brain death,
                  except for the presence of significant serum levels
                  of barbiturates (n=34), opiates (n=8), and
                  benzodiazepines (n=3) were distributed in three
                  groups according to the confirmatory test used;
                  group 1: waiting for the metabolic clearance of CNS
                  depressant drugs, or by demonstrating intracranial
                  circulatory arrest with 99mTc-HMPAO (group 2) or
                  transcranial Doppler (group 3). The delay in
                  diagnosing brain death by the three methods was
                  analyzed. RESULTS: The mean interval between the
                  presumptive and the definitive diagnosis of brain
                  death was 34.4+/-32.2 hr in group 1, 17.7+/-18.3 hr
                  in group 2, and 5.0+/-4.6 hr in group 3
                  (P=0.004). The between-groups analysis showed that
                  99mTc-HMPAO and transcranial Doppler decreased the
                  delay in diagnosing brain death with respect to
                  waiting for drug clearance by 49\% (P=0.16) and 85\%
                  (P\&lt;0.001), respectively. Moreover, transcranial
                  Doppler decreased this time by 72\% with respect to
                  99mTc-HMPAO (P\&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial
                  Doppler ultrasound and 99mTc-HMPAO brain
                  scintigraphy can significantly reduce the time taken
                  to confirm brain death in patients with significant
                  serum levels of CNS depressant drugs. In this
                  setting, transcranial Doppler is superior to
                  99mTc-HMPAO in reducing the waiting time for a firm
                  diagnosis of brain death.},

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: National sharing of cadaveric renal
                  allografts for perfectly matched kidneys (0 antigen
                  mismatch) has improved outcome in the recipients of
                  these kidneys despite increasing cold storage
                  times. However, there may be limits to outcome
                  improvement of matched kidneys based on age and cold
                  storage time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine if
                  national sharing of kidneys based on matching
                  improves outcome regardless of donor age and cold
                  storage time, we evaluated the United Network for
                  Organ Sharing (UNOS) Scientific Registry for all
                  recipients of cadaveric kidney transplants between
                  January 1, 1990 and July 31, 1998. We divided the
                  recipients into four groups based on donor age and
                  cold storage time. Group 1 comprised young donors
                  (donor age \&lt;55 years) with average (\&lt;24 h)
                  cold storage time; group 2, young donors with long
                  (\&gt;/=24 h) cold storage time; group 3, older
                  donors (donor age \&gt;/=55 years) with average cold
                  storage time; and group 4, older donors with long
                  cold storage time. RESULTS: A total of 64,046
                  recipients were evaluated: 35,061 (55\%) in group 1,
                  21,264 (33\%) in group 2, 4308 (7\%) in group 3, and
                  3414 (5\%) in group 4. Early graft performance
                  progressively decreased from group 1 to group
                  4. Delayed graft function (DGF: dialysis requirement
                  in the first 7 days posttransplant) was 18, 29, 33,
                  and 42\% (P \&lt; 0.0001); serum creatinine at 3
                  years (in mg/dl) was 1.70 +/- 0.8, 1.73 +/- 0.9,
                  2. 31 +/- 1.0, and 2.42 +/- 1.1 (P \&lt; 0.0001);
                  1-year graft survival was 87, 84, 79, and 77\% (P
                  \&lt; 0.0001); and 3-year graft survival was 77, 74,
                  63, and 62\% (P \&lt; 0.0001, for groups 1 and 2 vs
                  groups 3 and 4, respectively). The trends in DGF
                  persisted through the groups in 0 antigen mismatched
                  kidneys. CONCLUSIONS: Early function is adversely
                  affected by prolonged cold storage, despite
                  matching, in recipients of younger and older donor
                  kidneys. Long-term function does not appear to be
                  affected by prolonged cold storage. Recipients of
                  kidneys from donors \&gt;/=55 years of age have
                  significantly worse short- and long-term outcome and
                  may not benefit from national sharing. Copyright

                  transplantation with kidneys from a donor with a
                  history of World Health Organization Class IV/V
                  lupus nephritis, and we report their clinical and
                  pathological outcome. METHODS: The donor had a
                  diagnosis of lupus nephritis made by renal biopsy 5
                  years before donation. At the time of donation, a
                  biopsy was performed on the donor and on one of the
                  recipients at 2 months and 1 year after the
                  transplant. RESULTS: Both recipients underwent
                  uneventful renal transplantation. On the first
                  postoperative day, the donor's final pathological
                  results became available. Although the frozen
                  section seemed to be quite benign, the permanent
                  sections revealed World Health Organization Class
                  II/V lupus nephritis, with full house
                  immunofluorescence and multiple electron dense
                  deposits. Biopsies were performed on recipient \#2
                  at 8 weeks and 1 year after the transplant. These
                  revealed marked diminution followed by complete
                  resolution of all tubular reticular structures and
                  deposits as well as immunofluorescent activity. Both
                  recipients remain with normal renal function and
                  urinalysis at 3 years after the
                  transplant. CONCLUSION: Although a history of
                  clinically significant renal disease has been
                  considered an absolute contraindication to kidney
                  donation, with appropriate workup and caution,
                  select patients may still be considered, which would
                  increase the potential donor pool.},

  abstract =	 {Renal transplantation is the ideal renal replacement
                  therapy for treatment of end stage kidney failure
                  but its limitation is the constant shortage of
                  cadaveric donors. While the traditional source of
                  cadaveric kidneys is procurement from heart-beating
                  donors, organ procurement from non-heart-beating
                  donors (NHBD) would help in coping with the rising
                  demand for organs. However various important legal,
                  logistic and technical constraints have limited the
                  implementation of such a procurement
                  programme. Nevertheless, prolonged warm ischaemic
                  times in procuring kidneys from NHB donors may
                  affect the viability of these organs and adversely
                  affect overall outcome after transplant. Fifty-three
                  consecutive patients who underwent renal
                  allotransplantation (Tx) between January and
                  December 1994 at the Singapore General Hospital were
                  retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes after renal
                  transplantation among 25 heart-beating donor (HBD)
                  and 28 NHBD were compared. Despite significant
                  differences in donor age (23.7 +/- 11.0 and 34.1 +/-
                  7.9, P = 0.001), first warm (0 and 22.2 +/- 9.0
                  minutes) and cold ischaemic times (12.8 +/- 6.7 and
                  5.2 +/- 5.0 hours, P = 0.001) between the HBD and
                  NHBD groups, the two-year patient and graft
                  survivals were very similar in both groups (100\%
                  versus 98\% and 98\% versus 96\%). The incidence of
                  delayed graft function (DF) was also comparable
                  between the HBD (41\%) and the NHBD (50\%) Tx. These
                  results suggest that NHBD is a viable source for
                  kidney transplants and comparable patient and graft
                  survivals can be achieved if the first warm and cold
                  ischaemic times are kept to the minimum.},

  abstract =	 {The increasing number of patients listed for liver
                  transplantation and the persistent low number of
                  potential donors have led, in recent years, to the
                  expansion of organ availability, as is the case of
                  liver procurement from elderly donors. So far,
                  results reported in the literature are controversial
                  and only a few reports described satisfactory
                  outcomes of transplantation using donors older than
                  60 years. In the case presented herein, we report
                  the successful elective liver transplantation of a
                  65 year-old patient, who received a graft from an 87
                  year-old donor, whose well-preserved hemodynamic
                  conditions, normal hepatic function, absence of
                  parenchymal alterations, as well as short ischemia
                  time, were the key points for this good
                  outcome. Even very old donors can be suitable for
                  liver transplantation. A careful evaluation of all
                  the possible donor-related risk factors, mostly the
                  presence of steatotic changes at liver biopsy, is
                  always mandatory.},

  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: The shortage of cadaveric livers has
                  sparked an interest in adult-to-adult living donor
                  transplantation. Right lobe donor hepatectomy is
                  frequently required to obtain a graft of adequate
                  size for adult recipients. Careful donor selection
                  is necessary to minimize complications and assure a
                  functional graft. METHODS: A four-step evaluation
                  protocol was used for donor selection and
                  satisfactory results of all tests in each step were
                  required before proceeding to the next. Donors were
                  selected based on a battery of laboratory studies
                  chosen to exclude unrecognized infection, liver
                  disease, metabolic disorders, and conditions
                  representing undue surgical risk. Imaging studies
                  included ultrasonography, angiography, magnetic
                  resonance imaging, and intraoperative
                  cholangiography and ultrasonography. The information
                  obtained from liver biopsy was used to correct the
                  estimated graft mass for the degree of
                  steatosis. RESULTS: From March 1998 to August 1999,
                  126 candidates were evaluated for living donation. A
                  total of 35 underwent donor right lobectomy with no
                  significant complications. Forty percent of all
                  donors that came to surgery were genetically
                  unrelated to the recipient. A total of 69\% of those
                  evaluated were excluded. ABO incompatibility was the
                  primary reason for exclusion after the first step
                  (71\%) and the presence of steatosis yielding an
                  inadequate estimated graft mass after the second
                  step (20\%). CONCLUSIONS: Donor selection limits the
                  application of living donor liver transplantation in
                  the adult population. Unrelated individuals increase
                  the size of the donor pool. Right lobe hepatectomy
                  can be performed safely in healthy adult liver
                  donors. Preoperative liver biopsy is an essential
                  part of the evaluation protocol, particularly when
                  the estimated graft mass is marginal.},

                  evaluate the effect of low-potassium dextran (LPD)
                  solution on organ function in human lung
                  transplantation. METHODS: A total of 80 patients
                  were included in this study. Donor lungs were
                  flushed with Euro-Collins (EC) solution in 48 cases
                  or LPD (Perfadex) in 32 cases. Subsequently, single-
                  (EC: n = 31; LPD: n = 15) or double-lung
                  transplantations (EC: n = 17; LPD: n = 17) were
                  performed. The evaluation parameters of transplant
                  function were the reperfusion injury score (grade I
                  to V); the alveolar/arterial oxygen ratio; the
                  duration of respirator therapy; and the length of
                  intensive care treatment and survival. RESULTS:
                  Incidence and severity of reperfusion injury score
                  were more severe in the EC group (31 of 48: grade I:
                  n = 13; II: n = 8; III: n = 5; IV: n = 2; V: n = 3;
                  LPD group: 17 of 32 patients; grade I: n = 12; II: n
                  = 1; III: n = 3; IV: n = 0 grade V: n = 0), leading
                  to death in three patients. In the LPD group,
                  despite of the use of cardiopulmonary bypass,
                  alveolar/arterial oxygen ratio values were
                  significantly (P = 0.009) better during the early
                  postoperative phase. Thirty-day mortality was 12\%
                  in the EC group and 6\% in the LPD group. The
                  one-year survival rate was 79\% after the use of LPD
                  (vs. EC: 62\%). CONCLUSIONS: Graft preservation
                  using LPD leads to better immediate and intermediate
                  graft function after pulmonary transplantation and
                  also results in better long-term survival.},

                  developed countries of the world have made
                  tremendous strides in organ donation and
                  transplantation. However, in this area of medicine,
                  Japan has been slow to follow. Japanese ethics,

                  the Japanese have only recently started to

                  transplantation of major organs has been hindered in

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Over a 12 month period, the Israel
                  Transplant Center doubled the number of donors by
                  assigning a nurse coordinator to each of 22
                  hospitals around the country and by using kidneys
                  from elderly donors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
                  impact of our \&quot;marginal donors\&quot; policy
                  on the results immediately following
                  transplantation. METHODS: Between October 1997 and
                  September 1998, 140 cadaveric kidney
                  transplantations from 72 donors were performed in
                  Israel. We defined two groups of recipients:
                  patients with immediate graft function and patients
                  with either delayed graft function requiring \&gt; 1
                  week of dialysis post-transplant or with primary
                  graft non-function. We compared the following
                  parameters between groups: donor and recipient age
                  and gender, cause of donor's death, length of stay
                  in the intensive care unit, vasopressor dosage and
                  creatinine levels before harvesting, cold ischemic
                  time, and the number of recipient grafts. RESULTS:
                  There were 102 recipients (72.8\%) with immediate
                  graft function and 38 with either PNF (n = 13,
                  9.3\%) or DGF (n = 25, 17.9\%). On regression
                  analysis, donor age \&gt; 50 year and
                  retransplantation were significant risk factors for
                  PNF or DGF (odds ratio 4.4 and 2.8,
                  respectively). Of the 56 kidneys from donors \&gt;
                  50 years old, 21 (37.5\%) developed either PNF (n =
                  9) or DGF (n = 12). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
                  kidneys from donors over age 50 are at increased
                  risk for graft non-function or delayed
                  function. Better assessment of functional capacity
                  of kidneys from \&quot;aged\&quot; donors may help
                  to choose appropriate donors from that pool.},

  abstract =	 {PURPOSE: Asking the family of a deceased patient to
                  consider eye donation is one of the most difficult
                  aspects of the donation process. The aim of this
                  prospective study was to describe the content of
                  interviews with the families of potential donors and
                  to analyze their reactions to improve the process of
                  eye donation. METHODS: We consecutively met with 151
                  families of suitable corneal donors at the Rouen
                  University Hospital. All interviews with donor
                  families were analyzed using a preestablished
                  questionnaire. RESULTS: In only 17.9\% of cases was
                  the family aware of the potential donor's last
                  will. In 77.7\% of these cases, the patient wished
                  to donate. Procurement rate was 71.5\%. This
                  acceptance was mostly facilitated by the awareness
                  and motivation of the hospital staff, the experience
                  of the physician, and the 13.3-h period of time
                  allowed after the donor's death. The commitment on
                  the part of the ophthalmologist to carry out optimal
                  anatomical restoration was a very important point
                  for 32\% of families who accepted
                  donation. Twenty-one percent of families asked for a
                  delay for reflection. This delay helped to obtain a
                  positive response in 72.7\% of cases and even
                  sometimes helped families to reconsider a previously
                  negative position (14\% of initial
                  refusals). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that a high
                  positive response (71.5\%) can be obtained from the
                  donor's family when a trained and motivated group
                  manages the post-mortem cornea donation request.},

  Title =	 {Are wedge biopsies of cadaveric kidneys obtained at
                  procurement reliable?},
  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Single wedge biopsy of cadaveric kidneys
                  from donors older than 55 is currently the standard
                  method of evaluating their viability for
                  transplantation. The degree of glomerulosclerosis
                  presently determines whether a kidney can be
                  transplanted, but most biopsies sample only the
                  subcapsular region and may not accurately represent
                  the true renal architecture. Our study evaluated the
                  accuracy of transplant suitability determinations
                  based upon the single wedge biopsy of cadaveric
                  kidneys. METHODS: We took kidneys that were refused
                  by UNOS centers on the basis of biopsy results,
                  examined their histology in detail, and reviewed
                  donor medical histories. Sections were taken from
                  the upper, lower, and mid-portion of each kidney and
                  stained with the periodic acid Schiff
                  stain. Percentage and location of glomerulosclerosis
                  and other relevant pathology were then determined in
                  each section. We compared our findings with the
                  results of the original wedge biopsies obtained at
                  the time of procurement. RESULTS: Nine kidneys were
                  obtained and examined. The wedge biopsies at the
                  time of procurement showed glomerulosclerosis
                  ranging from 8 to 36\% (median 17\%). The multiple
                  kidney sections we analyzed showed fewer sclerosed
                  glomeruli, ranging from 3 to 15\% (median 7\%,
                  P\&lt;0.001), with most of the sclerosed glomeruli
                  identified located in the immediate subcapsular
                  region (P\&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Wedge biopsies of
                  donor kidneys can overestimate the total amount of
                  glomerulosclerosis, apparently because of a
                  predominance of sclerosis in the kidney's
                  subcapsular region, the area predominantly sampled
                  by the usual wedge biopsy. These inappropriately
                  high estimates of glomerulosclerosis can result in
                  refusal of kidneys that might be suitable for
                  transplantation.},

  abstract =	 {The incentive to develop intrafamilial living
                  related liver transplantation (LRLT) originated from
                  the shortage of cadaveric organ supply. We report
                  our experience with LRLT in 63 children during
                  1993-1998 in the frame of a protocol approved by the
                  Ethics Committee of our Institution. During this
                  period, 152 potential intrafamilial (mostly
                  parental) donors were evaluated; 44 (28.5\%) were
                  excluded because of surgical (n = 4), medical (n =
                  39) or psychosocial reason (n = 1). Out of 108 who
                  matched all medical, surgical and psychological
                  criteria of selection, 45 did not underwent living
                  donation because their child received a cadaveric
                  graft (n = 22; LRLT was their second option) or
                  because one of the parents who had both been
                  selected was chosen [by the surgical team because of
                  more favourable anatomy (n = 8) or by mutual
                  agreement between the two parents (n =
                  5)]. Sixty-three living donors (36 mothers, 24
                  fathers, one grand mother, one aunt and one uncle)
                  underwent procurement of the left lobe (n = 52), the
                  left lobe extended to part of segment IV (n = 8) or
                  a left hepatectomy (n = 3) without mortality or any
                  serious morbidity. Their median hospital stay was 7
                  days (range: 6-12); full physical rehabilitation and
                  normalization of liver tests were usually obtained
                  within three weeks. Their psychological follow-up
                  did not disclose any longstanding serious
                  sequellae. The median age of the recipients was 13
                  months (range 5-189); 30 were younger than one year
                  at the time of transplant. Their median weight was
                  8.1 kg (range: 4.3 to 60); 36 had an actual weight
                  under 10 kg. Fifty-two received an ABO identical and
                  11 received an ABO compatible transplant. The native
                  liver diseases were similar to common data in
                  children, with biliary atresia being the most
                  frequent indication (74.6\%). The median weight of
                  the graft was 260 gr (range: 138-680) with a median
                  ratio between the graft weight and the recipient
                  body weight of 3.17\% (range: 0.75-8.08). All grafts
                  were implanted orthotopically with
                  semi-microvascular reconstruction of the hepatic
                  vein, portal vein and hepatic artery [end to end
                  anastomosis in 58 (2 arteries were reconstructed in
                  7 patients) and interposition of an iliac arterial
                  allograft from the infrarenal aorta in 5]. Base line
                  immunosuppression consisted of a triple drug regimen
                  including steroids, Azathioprine and either
                  Cyclosporine-Sandimmun (n = 9), Cyclosporine
                  Microemulsion formulation-Neoral (n = 13) or
                  Tacrolimus-Prograft (n = 41). Biopsy-proved acute
                  rejection was treated with intravenous bolus of
                  steroids; steroid-resistant acute rejection was
                  treated by a switch from Cyclosporine to Tacrolimus
                  or addition of Mycophenolate-Mofetil (Cellcept) in
                  Tacrolimus treated patients. Actuarial patient
                  survival was 91.8\% and 89.6\% after LRLT at one and
                  five years post-transplant, respectively, and 87.5\%
                  and 82.8\% at one and five years, respectively, in
                  90 patients who received a cadaveric graft during
                  the same interval. Actuarial graft survival was
                  91.8\% and 84.1\% after LRLT at one and five years,
                  respectively, and 76.4\% and 73.3\% at one and five
                  years, respectively, after cadaveric
                  transplants. Vascular thrombosis was observed in
                  9.5\% of the patients (arterial thrombosis: 1.6\%;
                  portal thrombosis: 7.9\%) without graft
                  loss. Biliary complications were observed in 26.9\%
                  (bile leak from cut surface in 3.1\%, anastomotic
                  stricture in 22.2\% and intrahepatic stricture in
                  1.5\%); two patients died from septic shock possibly
                  related to uncompletely relieved anastomotic
                  stricture; all other biliary complications were
                  successfully treated either conservatively or
                  surgically. The incidence of acute rejection was
                  90.9\% in 22 patients with Cyclosporine-based
                  immunosuppression; acute rejection was
                  corticoresistant in 50\%. It was 46.3\% in 41
                  patients with Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression
                  (64\% with Prograft in capsules and 18.7\% with
                  Prograft in granules); no acute rejection was
                  corticoresistant. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: The potential supply of transplantable
                  cadaver kidneys is often expressed as donors per
                  million population (pmp), which ignores some
                  essential factors governing organ donation. METHODS:
                  We performed a modeled analysis of kidney donor
                  extraction rates by age, gender, race, cause of
                  death, geographic region, and year in a cohort of
                  evaluable deaths and actual cadaver donors between
                  the ages of 1 and 65 years (1988-1993). Evaluable
                  death was defined as an in-hospital death in
                  patients between the ages of 1 and 65 years whose
                  ICD-9-CM cause of death was not an obvious
                  contraindication to kidney donation. The main
                  outcome measures were the crude donation rate and an
                  adjusted donor extraction rate (DER) per 1000
                  evaluable deaths. RESULTS: A total of 1.4x10(6)
                  in-hospital deaths produced 300,502 evaluable deaths
                  and 20,575 actual donors. Between 1989 and 1993, DER
                  increased from 61.1 to 75 per 1,000 evaluable
                  deaths. DERs were highest among the youngest age
                  groups, declining significantly with age from 405.0
                  to 16.7/1,000 evaluable deaths for age groups 1-10
                  and 56-65 years, respectively. There was a small
                  difference in donors pmp between blacks and whites
                  (15 vs. 18). In contrast, DER was seven times higher
                  in whites compared with blacks (112.5 vs. 16.5/1,000
                  evaluable deaths; P\&lt;0.001). The crude donation
                  rate (per 1,000 evaluable deaths) was high for
                  stroke (604.8) and trauma-related deaths (230.6),
                  resulting in highly efficient donor extraction from
                  these deaths. Region-specific DERs ranged from 49.4
                  to 83/1,000 evaluable deaths and differed
                  significantly from the corresponding donors
                  pmp. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating kidney donation
                  relative to in-hospital evaluable deaths is a
                  meaningful measure of organ procurement
                  efficiency. Efforts to enhance cadaveric kidney
                  donation should seek to understand and reduce the
                  marked demographic and regional disparity in donor
                  extraction rates.},

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that pharmacologic
                  conditioning of the donor before organ procurement
                  may protect the renal allograft from injuries
                  associated with the cold ischemic period. We
                  compared the administration of two vasoactive agents
                  before organ procurement to: (1) determine their
                  influence on machine perfusion characteristics and
                  (2) determine their impact on delayed graft function
                  (DGF) in transplanted renal allografts. METHODS:
                  Between January 1997 and December 1998, 150 kidneys
                  were procured from heart-beating donors and
                  preserved in our laboratory by machine perfusion
                  (MP) or cold storage (CS). The following vasoactive
                  agents were randomly administered to the donor 5 min
                  before aortic cross clamp: phentolamine mesylate
                  (PM) or hydralazine (H). The control groups received
                  no donor conditioning. Kidneys were grouped as
                  follows: (1) MP+PM, (2) MP+H, (3) MP, (4) CS+PM, (5)
                  CS+H, (6) CS. 10 mg PM/50 kg donor weight was
                  administered to the PM groups and 20 mg H/50 kg
                  donor weight was administered to the H groups. DGF
                  was defined as the need for dialysis within the
                  first 7 days after the transplant. RESULTS: MP+PM
                  increased renal flow by 12\% and decreased renal
                  resistance by 18\% compared with the MP+H group, and
                  increased renal flow by 23\% and decreased renal
                  resistance by 30\% compared with the MP
                  group. Moreover, the MP+PM group was associated with
                  improved early allograft function. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Donor treatment with PM immediately before aortic
                  cross-clamp is associated with improved machine
                  perfusion dynamics (renal flow and renal resistance)
                  and lower incidence of DGF compared with donor
                  treatment with H or no treatment. Moreover, MP of
                  renal allografts was associated with improved early
                  function compared with CS grafts.},

  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {The high demand for organs for transplantation has
                  made it necessary to consider using even the oldest
                  and youngest of potential donors in order to
                  increase the organ supply. In this retrospective
                  study, the outcome of kidney transplantation using
                  cadaveric pediatric donors was compared with that of
                  an adult control series. Graft procurement took
                  place in two regions of Italy (Emilia-Romagna and
                  Piemonte) over an 11-year period. A group of
                  pediatric donors (\&lt; 15 years old, n = 30) was
                  compared with an adult donor group (n = 67). All
                  recipients were adults who received cyclosporin as
                  immunosuppression. Actuarial patient and graft
                  survival rates did not differ significantly between
                  the two groups (patient survival 96\% and 96\% for
                  pediatric donors versus 98\% and 92\% for adult
                  donors at 1 and 5 years post-transplantation; graft
                  survival 76\% and 68\% for pediatric donors versus
                  88\% and 74\% for adult donors 1 and 5 y
                  post-transplantation). Complications were also
                  evaluated, but no difference was found (the only
                  exception being the creatinine level in the 5th
                  year). Renal transplantation with cadaveric donors
                  starting at 4 years of age gave results comparable
                  to kidneys coming from adults. These data show that
                  cadaveric pediatric donor kidneys may be used in
                  adult recipients with good results. The ethical
                  implications of the subject are extensively

                  (HTN) and associated end-stage renal diseases (ESRD)
                  is 17 times greater in African Americans, this
                  minority group, which comprises only 12\% of the

                  22-24\% of kidney recipients, they comprise only

                  atherosclerosis. The natural history of RCE in renal
                  transplants is unknown. We have reviewed the
                  surgical pathology files of The Johns Hopkins
                  Hospital in the 14-year period between 1984 and
                  early 1999 and found 7 RCE cases among 1500 renal
                  transplant biopsies (0.47\%). One of the seven cases
                  had three biopsies showing cholesterol emboli, the
                  first of which was a postreperfusion (immediate
                  posttransplant) biopsy. The probable source of the
                  cholesterol emboli was the recipient in six cases
                  and the donor in one case. Five donors were
                  cadaveric and two were living donors. Six biopsies
                  were taken within the first 4 months posttransplant
                  (four were postreperfusion biopsies). One recent
                  patient had the inciting event of arteriography and
                  stent placement 2 years posttransplant and is
                  currently doing well. One kidney failed due to
                  posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD),
                  another kidney failed with complicating
                  opportunistic infections, and the other five were
                  functioning 2 to 6 years posttransplant. A
                  literature review revealed additional 14 RCE cases
                  in renal transplants. Combining our cases with those
                  in the literature (21 cases), reveals that the
                  origin of the RCE was probably the recipient in 11
                  cases (seven cadaveric, two living-related, and two
                  unknown), and the donor in 10 cases (eight cadaveric
                  and two unknown). Graft failure occurred in two of
                  the 11 cases, where RCE was of probable recipient
                  origin. Seven of the 10 kidneys, where the RCE was
                  probably of donor origin, failed due to allograft
                  dysfunction; one of them also developed superimposed
                  rejection and cytomegalovirus infection. We conclude
                  that if RCE is originating in the recipient, graft
                  survival is usually good. In contrast, if RCE is of
                  donor origin, graft dysfunction and subsequent graft
                  loss are common. The reason for this difference may
                  be the more extensive RCE developing in an
                  atherosclerotic cadaveric donor during organ
                  procurement or severe trauma leading to death.},

                  on the attitudes and opinions of families who were
                  asked to donate the organs of a deceased
                  relative. OBJECTIVE: To determine what variables
                  influenced a family's decision to donate. DESIGN:
                  Post hoc investigation using a survey. SETTING:
                  Malaga, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-one people who
                  had been approached for the donation of their
                  deceased relatives' organs at a single
                  hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Consent to
                  donate. RESULTS: Based on a stepwise discriminant
                  function analysis, the following variables played a
                  determining role in a family member's decision to
                  donate: (1) the expressed wish of the deceased, (2)
                  having a clear understanding of the definition of
                  \&quot;brain death.\&quot; (3) the manners and

                  facilities, (5) concerns regarding the donation
                  process, and (6) educational level. CONCLUSION:
                  Prodonation campaigns geared toward the public and
                  hospital staff should focus on specific objectives

                  and in situ techniques.},
  medlineref =	 {20155349},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The expanding applicability of
                  liver transplantation as treatment for end-stage
                  liver disease has fostered a disproportionate
                  increase in liver transplant candidates in the face
                  of an unchanging pool of donor organs. This has
                  resulted in disparities in pretransplant waiting
                  times and deaths. The splitting of a liver allograft
                  allows for the transplantation of 2 recipients,
                  usually an adult and a child, thus providing a means
                  to expand the cadaveric donor pool. METHODS: The
                  authors present their results on the performance of
                  an ex vivo (back table) split and in situ (in a
                  hemodynamically stable cadaveric donor) split to
                  evaluate safety, applicability, and
                  effectiveness. Between November 1989 through April
                  1998, 54 split-liver transplant recipient operations
                  were performed (24 pediatric and 30 adult). Thirty
                  donors were procured: the ex vivo splitting yielded
                  25 grafts from 13 donors (donor age, 24.6+/-11
                  years), and the in-situ technique yielded 29 grafts
                  from 17 donors (mean donor age of 25.5+/-10.4
                  years). Five donors involved interinstitutional
                  sharing for which the left side of the graft was
                  kept at the host hospital and the right side grafts
                  were utilized at our center. RESULTS: Overall 1-year
                  patient survival was 85\%, with a graft survival of
                  72\%. Patient survival was similar with ex vivo
                  (74\%) as compared with the in situ splitting group
                  (96\%; P = .06), as was graft survival in ex vivo
                  (61 \%) versus in situ (81\%) splitting (P =
                  .15). The pediatric population benefited most from
                  the in situ technique, with a 1-year patient
                  survival rate of 100\% with the in situ technique
                  versus the ex vivo technique survival rate of 64\%
                  at 1 year (P = .02). The 1-year graft survival
                  comparing these 2 techniques was 83\% for the in
                  situ group versus 45\% for the ex vivo
                  group. Analysis of the program evolution of
                  split-liver transplantation suggested a
                  time-dependent learning curve, which was applicable
                  to surgical splitting technique, implantation, and
                  recipient selection. CONCLUSIONS: The principle of
                  splitting livers from cadaveric donors is
                  fundamentally sound and technically feasible. The
                  authors' outcomes analysis using 2 different
                  procurement techniques suggests that the in situ
                  technique is clinically efficacious, can be used
                  alternatively with the ex vivo technique, and is
                  comparable to whole-liver allograft
                  transplantation.},

                  24 recipients of two marginal kidneys from donors
                  who were \&gt;60 yr old or who had diabetes,
                  hypertension, or non-nephrotic proteinuria (cases),
                  with that of 48 age- and gender-matched control
                  subjects who received single ideal grafts at the
                  same center and were given the same
                  immunosuppressive therapy. Marginal kidneys with no
                  macroscopic abnormalities were selected for the
                  double transplant on the basis of a predefined score
                  of histologic damage. Six-month patient and kidney
                  survival was 100\% with both of the
                  procedures. Incidence (20.8\% versus 20.8\%) and
                  median (range) duration of posttransplant anuria (5
                  [2 to 12] versus 7 [2 to 13] days) were comparable
                  in cases and control subjects, respectively. Time to
                  normal serum creatinine and mean serum creatinine
                  values at each time visit were comparable as well,
                  but with significantly lower levels in cases
                  compared with control subjects from month 2 to last
                  follow-up (1.56 +/- 0.65 versus 1.74 +/- 0.73 mg/dl,
                  P = 0.04). Diastolic BP values averaged during the
                  entire posttransplant period were significantly
                  lower in cases than in control subjects (83.2 +/-
                  11.5 versus 85.1 +/- 12.5 mmHg, respectively, P =
                  0.008). Donor/recipient body weight ratio was the
                  only covariate significantly associated at
                  univariate (P = 0.002) and multivariate (P = 0.001)
                  analysis with last available serum creatinine
                  concentrations. Incidence of acute allograft
                  rejections (20.8\% versus 18.8\%) and of major
                  surgical complications was comparable in the two
                  groups. No renal artery or vein thrombosis was
                  reported in either group. Dual transplants of
                  marginal kidneys are as safe and tolerated as single
                  transplants, and possibly offer an improved
                  filtration power without exposing the recipient to
                  enhanced risk of delayed renal function recovery,
                  acute allograft rejection, or major surgical
                  complications.},

                  and agreed while alive to undergo directed autopsies
                  after their deaths. These autopsies were undertaken
                  specifically to document the distribution of
                  metastases, characterize tumors phenotypically and
                  immunohistochemically, harvest fresh and snap frozen
                  tumor and normal control tissues suitable for
                  molecular examination, and establish cell lines via
                  passages through generations of severe combined
                  immunodeficient and athymic mice. Achievement of
                  these goals was obtained through the development of

                  no systemic vasodilators are used. RESULTS: RA
                  harvest commenced in December 1994. Between 1996 and
                  30 June 1998, 2167 RA were harvested and used to
                  construct 3105 coronary anastomoses. A dramatic rise
                  in RA use occurred during 1996. More than 80\% of
                  patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery
                  (CABG) have RA harvested since this time. Total
                  arterial revascularization rate also rose
                  dramatically and is currently 80\% of all CABG. This
                  rate has been assisted by a rapid rise in the use of
                  composite arterial grafting where aortic anastomoses
                  can be avoided and currently represents 40\% of all
                  CABG. Hand strength was tested in 328 non-selected
                  patients and was not reduced by RA harvest when hand
                  dominance was taken into account. Objective
                  sensation loss was present in 0.3\% for the
                  superficial radial nerve and 2.1\% for the lateral
                  cutaneous nerve of forearm. Pulse oximetry
                  observations detected statistically significant but
                  clinically irrelevant differences. Scar
                  hypersensitivity occurred in 20\%. Only two patients
                  of all patients undergoing RA harvest reported late
                  hand ischaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Harvest of the RA
                  within the neurovascular plane is simple and
                  associated with low morbidity.},

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: In organ transplantation, each country
                  has specific rules of allocation. We have
                  retrospectively evaluated the French liver
                  transplant waiting list for the period 1992-1996,
                  during which time the rules for allocation remained
                  stable. Mortality while on the waiting list and
                  waiting times were the two principal
                  endpoints. METHODS: Using the Etablissement Francais
                  des Greffes (EFG) registry, the study was conducted
                  in three steps: (1) description of the waiting list
                  population; (2) analysis of the outcome of patients,
                  with the use of a logistic model to explain death
                  while on the waiting list; (3) estimation of waiting
                  times and use of a Cox model to explain waiting
                  times. RESULTS: The distribution of patients with
                  regard to degree of urgency, age, blood type, and
                  liver disease was variable according to the the EFG
                  region. The outcome of patients was variable
                  according to blood type and to EFG region. Patients
                  classed as \&quot;extremely urgent\&quot; did not
                  have a different outcome compared to elective
                  patients. The logistic model indicated that two
                  factors influenced the death: blood group and EFG
                  region. Waiting times were variable according to EFG
                  region; age and blood group had an influence on
                  waiting times for a graft. The Cox model indicated
                  the independent influence of EFG region on waiting
                  times. CONCLUSION: We found geographical disparities
                  between patients with respect to time on the waiting
                  list. However, the database must be improved by
                  including the risk profile of each patient, leading
                  to changes in rules for a better allocation of

                  raised considerable concerns. METHOD: Twenty-six
                  laparoscopic live donor nephrectomies were done from
                  October 1997 to October 1998. RESULTS: All kidneys
                  had immediate function. All recipients except 1 had
                  serum creatinines less than 2.0 mg at 2 months

                  Hospital was established in 1985. By the end of
                  1998, there were 1,614 patients on the cumulative
                  waiting list. The first kidney transplantation (KT)
                  was started in 1986 by using kidney from
                  living-related donor (LD) while cadaveric KT (CD-KT)
                  was started in 1987. A total of 528 KT were done,
                  278 cases (52.7\%) were CD-KT and 250 cases (47.3\%)
                  were LD-KT. Six patients had two kidney
                  transplants. 278 kidneys were donated from 189
                  cadaveric donors. Fifty cadaveric donors (26.4\%)
                  were from Ramathibodi Hospital while the rest were
                  from other hospitals and the Organ Donation Center,
                  Thai Red Cross Society. For LD, 233 out of 250
                  (93.2\%) were from living-related, more than 50 per
                  cent of these donors were from siblings. 17 spousal
                  donors have been accepted for KT at Ramathibodi
                  Hospital since 1997. Concerning the recipient pools,
                  522 patients (32.3\%) were transplanted, 123
                  patients (7.6\%) died without KT, 111 patients
                  (6.9\%) underwent KT at other hospitals, and 78
                  patients (4.8\%) changed to waiting lists at other
                  hospitals. The rest were lost to follow-up. At
                  present, only 265 patients are still actively
                  waiting (send serum every month). The number of KT
                  and living donors has gradually increased, whereas,
                  the number of cadaveric donors has
                  decreased. However, cooperation with the
                  \&quot;Organ Donation Center\&quot; has improved the
                  number of cadaveric donation in the last two
                  years. Sufficient organ donations and an active

                  transplantation has a significantly worse outcome
                  when compared with primary (first time)
                  transplantation. Defining the risk factors for
                  mortality within this group has been difficult due
                  to small numbers of patients at individual
                  centers. METHODS: All cardiac retransplants
                  performed in the United States and registered in the
                  Joint International Society for Heart and Lung
                  Transplantation (ISHLT)/United Network for Organ
                  Sharing (UNOS) Thoracic Registry were analyzed for
                  demographics, morbidity posttransplantation,
                  immunosuppression, and risk factors for
                  mortality. RESULTS: The study cohort included 514
                  patients of which 81\% were male with a mean age of
                  47+/-12 years. Time from primary transplant to
                  retransplantation ranged from 1 day to 15.5 years
                  and more than 50\% of the patients underwent
                  retransplantation for chronic rejection. More than
                  60\% of patients were in the intensive care unit at
                  the time of retransplantation and more than 40\% of
                  the patients were reported to be on some form of
                  life support (ventricular assist device, ventilator,
                  and/or inotropic therapy). Survival for the entire
                  retransplant cohort was 65, 59, and 55\% for 1, 2,
                  and 3 years, respectively, but was substantially
                  lower when the intertransplant interval was
                  short. Conversely, when the interval between primary
                  and retransplantation was more than 2 years, 1 year
                  survival postretransplantation approached that of
                  primary transplantation. Additional independent risk
                  factors for mortality for the retransplant cohort
                  included overall cardiac transplant center volume,
                  the use of a ventricular assist device or
                  ventilator, the patient being in the intensive care
                  unit, and recipient age. The four most common causes
                  of death were infection, primary/nonspecific graft
                  failure, chronic rejection (allograft vasculopathy),
                  and acute rejection. CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm
                  that repeat heart transplantation is a higher risk
                  procedure than primary transplantation, especially
                  early after the primary heart transplant.},

                  found to downregulate the alloimmune response in a
                  number of experimental models. We conducted a
                  randomized, prospective, double blind, and
                  placebo-controlled trial to determine whether
                  heat-treated donor spleen cells would affect early
                  rejection after liver transplantation. Donor spleen
                  was obtained during organ procurement for 40
                  patients undergoing liver transplantation. All
                  patients were treated with cyclosporine,
                  azathioprine and steroids. The patients were
                  randomized after surgery to receive either
                  heat-treated (45 degrees C for 1 h) spleen cells or
                  placebo. Patients underwent protocol biopsies at 1
                  wk, 4 and 12 months, or as needed. Biopsies were
                  reviewed in a blind fashion and scored according to
                  the Banff consensus criteria. Randomization resulted
                  in 19 patients in the spleen cell group and 21 in
                  the placebo group. One-yr graft survival was 94 and
                  100\%, respectively. Early rejection was more
                  frequent in the spleen cell group (61 vs. 35\%, p,
                  not significant). The histopathological rejection
                  activity index at 7 d was also higher for the
                  patients in the spleen cell group: 39\% of spleen
                  cell treated patients had a score of 4 or higher as
                  opposed to 5\% in the placebo group (p \&lt;
                  0.01). The mean score was 2.9 +/- 2.8 for the spleen
                  cell group versus 1.3 + 1.7 for the placebo group (p
                  = 0.034). It is concluded that heat-treated donor
                  spleen cells given within 24 h after liver
                  transplantation were not clinically beneficial and
                  increased the intensity of rejection in 7-d protocol

  abstract =	 {The present study was designed to characterize the
                  response of human penile dorsal artery and deep
                  dorsal vein to dilator drugs used in the diagnosis
                  and treatment of erectile dysfunction with special
                  emphasis on the effects on sympathetic
                  neurotransmission. Ring segments of penile dorsal
                  artery and deep dorsal vein were obtained from 20
                  multi-organ donors during procurement of organs for
                  transplantation. The rings (3 mm long) were
                  suspended in organ bath chambers for isometric
                  recording of tension. We then studied the relaxant
                  responses to prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), vasoactive
                  intestinal peptide (VIP), papaverine (PV), sodium
                  nitroprusside (SNP) and linsidomine chlorhydrate
                  (SIN-1), and analysed the effects of these drugs on
                  contractions induced by stimulation of perivascular
                  sympathetic nerves. In artery and vein rings
                  contracted by noradrenaline, all the drugs tested
                  caused concentration-dependent relaxation. The order
                  of potencies in terms of IC50 values (concentration
                  of agonist causing 50\% of the maximal relaxation)
                  was PGE1=VIP\&gt;SNP\&gt;SIN-1=PV. Both arteries and
                  veins contracted to electrical field stimulation (15
                  V, 0.5-2 Hz, 0.2 ms duration for 15 s) in a
                  frequency-dependent manner. All relaxant drugs
                  caused concentration-dependent inhibition of
                  neurogenic contractions; the relative order of
                  potencies was PGE1\&gt;VIP\&gt;SNP\&gt;SIN-1=PV. It
                  is concluded that inhibition of sympathetic activity
                  constitutes an effective relaxing mechanism in
                  penile dorsal artery and vein. Modulation of
                  sympathetic activity together with the direct
                  effects on smooth muscle should be considered to
                  evaluate adequately the efficacy of relaxant drugs
                  to increase human penile blood supply.},

                  and midterm function of kidneys from non-heart
                  beating donors (NHBD) with those of kidneys from
                  heart beating donors (HBD). From 1989 to 1998, 144
                  kidneys were procured from NHBD at the Hospital
                  Clinico San Carlos in Madrid, of which 95 were
                  transplanted. The kidney grafts were maintained from
                  the moment of the diagnosis of cardiac arrest until
                  the time of procurement by cardiopulmonary
                  bypass. There was no significant difference in renal
                  function and the number of rejection episodes
                  between the NHBD and HBD transplants. The NHBD
                  kidneys showed a 5.73-fold increase in the incidence
                  of delayed graft function (adjusted relative risk
                  95\% confidence interval, 2.82 to 11.62). One- and
                  five-year survival rates for NHBD grafts were 84.6
                  and 82.7\%, respectively, compared with 87.5 and
                  83.9\% for HBD (P = 0.5767). Cox analysis showed
                  that the predictive factors for worse NHBD graft
                  survival were type of NHBD donor and the occurrence
                  of corticoresistant rejection. Ninety of the NHBD
                  organs were procured from subjects suffering
                  irreversible cardiac arrest on the street who were
                  transferred to our center for the sole purpose of
                  donation. Fifty-four of these kidneys were
                  transplanted and all showed primary function. When a
                  strict protocol is adhered to, the outcome of renal
                  transplant from NHBD compares well with that from
                  HBD. It is believed that the high number of organs
                  obtained from subjects undergoing irreversible
                  cardiac arrest on the street might encourage the
                  adoption of new criteria for the management of this
                  type of pathology with the ultimate goal of kidney
                  donation.},

                  postoperative graft dysfunction in human orthotopic
                  liver transplantation (OLT). However, the effects of
                  the correction of donor hypernatremia before organ
                  procurement have not been confirmed. The aim of this
                  study is to determine whether donor hypernatremia is
                  associated with early graft dysfunction after OLT
                  and to determine the effect of the correction of
                  donor hypernatremia. One hundred eighty-one
                  consecutive OLTs performed between May 1997 and July
                  1998 were entered onto this study. The cases were
                  divided into three groups according to the donor
                  serum sodium concentration: group A, serum sodium of
                  155 mEq/L or less before organ procurement (n =

                  and final sodium 155 mEq/L or less (n = 36); and
                  group C, final sodium greater than 155 mEq/L (n =
                  27). Graft survival within 90 days after OLT and
                  early postoperative graft function were
                  analyzed. There were no significant differences in
                  donor and recipient variables among the three
                  groups. The frequencies of graft loss were 15 of 118
                  grafts (12.7\%) in group A, 4 of 36 grafts (11.1\%)
                  in group B, and 9 of 27 grafts (33.3\%; P \&lt;.05 v
                  groups A and B) in group C. The liver enzyme values
                  in groups B and C were significantly greater than
                  those in group A postoperatively. The prothrombin
                  times of group C were significantly longer than
                  those of group A for the first 4 postoperative
                  days. Recipients of hepatic allografts from donors
                  with uncorrected hypernatremia had a significantly
                  greater incidence of graft loss compared with
                  recipients of hepatic allografts from normonatremic
                  donors. However, the differences in graft survival
                  were abrogated by the correction of donor
                  hypernatremia before procurement.},

                  brief cardiopulmonary arrest may sustain ischemic
                  damage before organ procurement. However, there is
                  no reported correlation between donor
                  cardiopulmonary arrest and hepatic allograft
                  dysfunction. On the other hand, brief
                  ischemia-reperfusion injury has been shown
                  experimentally to result in protection in several
                  organ models. Induction of ischemic tolerance has
                  been called ischemic preconditioning. Our objective
                  was to study the influence of brief donor
                  cardiopulmonary arrest on hepatic allograft outcome
                  in human liver transplantation. Between May 1997 and
                  July 1998, 181 consecutive orthotopic liver
                  transplant (OLT) cases were divided into 2 groups
                  based on the occurrence of donor cardiopulmonary
                  arrest. Group A consisted of 37 donors who suffered
                  a cardiopulmonary arrest. Group B consisted of the
                  remaining 144 patients. Liver graft survival within
                  90 days of OLT and early postoperative graft
                  function were analyzed. Although there was
                  significant liver damage resulting from circulatory
                  failure during cardiopulmonary arrest before organ
                  procurement in group A, graft survival was not
                  affected. After OLT, the mean peak aspartate
                  transaminase and alanine transaminase concentrations
                  in group A (1, 444.1 and 718.2 U/L) were
                  significantly lower than those in group B (2,382.8
                  and 1,507.3 U/L) (P \&lt;.05). Experiences of brief
                  cardiopulmonary arrest in organ donors did not
                  affect post-OLT hepatic allograft survival and
                  function. Although the liver function tests are
                  elevated in an organ donor, the hepatic allograft is
                  suitable for OLT if the liver damage is induced by
                  brief donor cardiopulmonary arrest.},

  abstract =	 {OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of insurance status
                  on access to kidney transplantation among California
                  dialysis patients. STUDY SETTING: California
                  Medicare and Medicaid dialysis populations. STUDY
                  DESIGN: All California ESRD dialysis patients under
                  age 65 eligible for Medicare or Medicaid in 1991 (n
                  = 9,102) took part in this cohort analytic
                  study. DATA COLLECTION: Medicare and California
                  Medicaid Program data were matched to the Organ
                  Procurement and Transplantation Network Kidney Wait
                  List files. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Only 31.4 percent of
                  California Medicaid dialysis patients were placed on
                  the kidney transplant waiting list compared to 38.8
                  percent and 45.0 percent of dually eligible
                  Medicate/Medicaid and Medicare patients,
                  respectively. Compared to the Medicaid population,
                  Medicare enrollees were more likely to be placed on
                  the kidney transplant waiting list (adjusted
                  Relative Risk [RR] = 2.10, Confidence Interval [CI]
                  1.68, 2.62) as were dually eligible patients (RR =
                  1.54, CI 1.24, 1.91). Once on the waiting list,
                  however, Medicare enrollment did not influence the
                  adjusted median waiting time to acquire a first
                  cadaveric transplant (p \&gt; .05). CONCLUSIONS:
                  California dialysis patients excluded from Medicare
                  coverage, who are disproportionately minority,
                  female, and poor, are much less likely to enter the
                  U.S. transplant system. We hypothesize that patient
                  concerns with potential subsequent loss of insurance
                  coverage as well as cultural and educational
                  barriers are possible explanatory factors. Once in
                  the system, however, insurance status does not
                  influence receipt of a cadaveric renal transplant.},

                  costs after orthotopic liver transplantation.},
  medline-pt =	 {JOURNAL ARTICLE},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: The burgeoning influence of managed care
                  in transplantation, coupled with a shrinking
                  health-care dollar, has placed most transplant
                  programs under intense pressure to cut costs. We
                  undertook a retrospective cost-identification
                  analysis to determine what clinical variables
                  influenced financial outcomes after orthotopic
                  cadaver liver transplants (OLTx). METHODS: Fifty
                  patients receiving 53 transplants between April 1995
                  and November 1996 were reviewed. Clinical data were
                  obtained from our institution's transplant database,
                  and total costs (not charges) for the transplant
                  admission and the 6 months after transplant were
                  obtained with use of an activity-based cost
                  accounting system (HBOC Trendstar, Atlanta,
                  Ga). RESULTS: The average total cost of second
                  transplants (n = 5) was \$97,262 greater than for
                  first transplants (n = 48, P \&lt; .05). Patients
                  transplanted initially as United Network for Organ
                  Sharing (UNOS) status 2 (n = 20) incurred average
                  costs that were \$51,762 higher than for patients
                  transplanted as UNOS status 3 (n = 28, P =
                  .008). Patients with a major bacterial or fungal
                  infection (n = 28) incurred average costs \$46,282
                  higher than recipients who were infection free (n =
                  22, P = .02). Multivariate analysis demonstrated
                  that only length of stay, retransplantation, and
                  postoperative dialysis were significantly and
                  independently correlated with costs (r2 =
                  .605). When the model was repeated with preoperative
                  variables alone, only UNOS status was significantly
                  correlated with 6-month total costs (P = .006, r2 =
                  .16). CONCLUSIONS: Length of stay is the most
                  important determinant of costs after OLTx. Rational
                  strategies to design cost-effective protocols after
                  OLTx will require further studies to truly define
                  the cost of various morbidities and outcomes after
                  OLTx.},

                  The specific center at which an individual was

                  causes of ESRD who were included in the US Renal
                  Data System from 1987 to 1995. Using Cox regression
                  models that adjusted for differences in age, sex,
                  race, region of residence, and year of onset of
                  ESRD, patients with ESRD caused by lupus nephritis
                  were as likely as patients with other causes of ESRD
                  to receive a living related renal transplant
                  (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02; 95\% confidence
                  interval [CI], 0.93 to 1.10; P = 0.70) but were 20\%
                  less likely to receive a cadaveric renal transplant
                  (adjusted HR = 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.85; P \&lt;
                  0.0001). Patients with ESRD caused by lupus
                  nephritis were significantly more likely to be
                  entered onto a waiting list for cadaveric renal
                  transplantation (adjusted HR = 1. 15; 95\% CI, 1.10
                  to 1.21; P \&lt; 0.0001) but were less likely to
                  receive a cadaveric transplant once entered onto a
                  waiting list (adjusted HR = 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.69 to
                  0.78; P \&lt; 0.0001). Patients with ESRD caused by
                  lupus nephritis had equal access to living related
                  renal transplantation and greater enrollment on
                  waiting lists for cadaveric transplantation than
                  patients with ESRD from other causes, indicating
                  that medical ineligibility is not a major barrier to
                  transplantation. Both medical and nonmedical factors
                  may contribute to the decreased likelihood of
                  cadaveric transplantation among patients with ESRD
                  caused by lupus nephritis.},
