		  estimating potential solid organ donors and measuring
		  donation performance in a geographic region based on
		  readily available data on the hospitals in that region.
		  METHODS: Medical records were reviewed in a stratified
		  random sample of 89 hospitals from 3 regions to attain a
		  baseline of donor potential. Data on a range of hospital
		  characteristics were collected and tested as predictors of
		  donor potential through the use of hierarchical Poisson
		  regression modeling. RESULTS: Five hospital characteristics
		  predicted donor potential: hospital deaths, hospital
		  Medicare case-mix index, total hospital staffed beds,
		  medical school affiliation, and trauma center
		  certification. Regional estimates were attained by
		  aggregating individual hospital estimates. Confidence
		  intervals for these regional estimates indicated that
		  actual donations represented from 28\% to 44\% of the
		  potential in the regions studied. CONCLUSIONS: This
		  methodology accurately estimates organ donor potential
		  within 3 geographic regions and lays the foundation for
		  evaluating organ donation effectiveness nationwide.
		  Additional research is needed to test the validity of the
		  model in other geographic regions and to further explore
		  organ donor potential in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds.

  optnote	= {OBJECTIVES--To estimate the potential supply of organ
		  donors and to measure the efficiency of organ procurement
		  efforts in the United States. METHODS--A geographic
		  database has been developed consisting of multiple cause of
		  death and sociodemographic data compiled by the National
		  Center for Health Statistics. All deaths are evaluated as
		  to their potential for organ donation. Two classes of
		  potential donors are identified: class 1 estimates are
		  restricted to causes of death involving significant head
		  trauma only, and class 2 estimates include class 1
		  estimates as well as deaths in which brain death was less
		  probable. RESULTS--Over 23,000 people are currently
		  awaiting a kidney, heart, liver, heart-lung, pancreas, or
		  lung transplantation. Donor supply is inadequate, and the
		  number of donors remained unchanged at approximately 4000
		  annually for 1986 through 1989, with a modest 9.1\%
		  increase in 1990. Between 6900 and 10,700 potential donors
		  are available annually (eg, 28.5 to 43.7 per million
		  population). Depending on the class of donor considered,
		  organ procurement efforts are between 37\% and 59\%
		  efficient. Efficiency greatly varies by state and organ
		  procurement organization. CONCLUSIONS--Many more organ
		  donors are available than are being accessed through
		  existing organ procurement efforts. Realistically, it may
		  be possible to increase by 80\% the number of donors
		  available in the United States (up to 7300 annually). It is
		  conceivable, although unlikely, that the supply of donor
		  organs could achieve a level to meet demand. }

		  of a White patient was approached for donation were nearly
		  twice those for a family of an African American. The odds
		  of donation also differed by race, but the magnitude varied
		  by patient and hospital characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Much
		  attention directed toward racial disparity in donation has
		  focused on attitudes of the public. The behavior of

		  throughout the cadaveric organ donation process, timely
		  access to the operating theater for surgical recovery of
		  organs and tissues can be one of the most problematic.
		  Delay in recovery adds to cost, risks organ viability, and
		  compounds donor family anguish with compromise to donation
		  consent. METHODS: From March 1 to November 30, 2001, 25
		  cadaveric donors were selected and successfully transferred
		  from local donor critical care units to an off-site
		  facility, which was constructed, equipped, and staffed to
		  allow surgical recovery of organs and tissues. Assessment
		  of the recovery process and outcome results was compared to
		  42 consecutive, hospital-based, organ recoveries within the
		  Mid-American Transplant Services (MTS) organ procurement
		  organization region. RESULTS: Twenty-five MTS-facility and
		  42 hospital organ recoveries were successfully conducted
		  with no technical losses and satisfactory function in all
		  206 transplanted organs. From the MTS donor group, 7
		  hearts, 4 lungs, 21 livers, 28 kidneys, and 5 pancreases
		  were successfully transplanted. Statistically significant
		  in the MTS group was higher donor age (44.1 vs. 30.2
		  years), shorter total donor management time (539 vs. 718
		  min), reduced delay in start of surgery (25 vs. 77 min),
		  shorter cold ischemia time for recovered pancreases (355
		  vs. 630 min), and reduced mean cost per donor (\$10,636 vs.
		  \$12,918). There was no significant difference in race,
		  gender, cause of death, vasopressor requirements, organs
		  per donor recovered (3.12 vs. 3.62) or transplanted (2.60
		  vs. 3.36), rate of tissue recoveries (68% vs. 67%), total
		  operating room time (207 vs. 200 min.), or cold ischemia
		  time (excluding pancreas). CONCLUSIONS: Cadaveric-donor
		  multiorgan and tissue recovery at this hospital-independent
		  facility was successfully accomplished in a manner
		  indistinguishable from conventional hospital organ and
		  tissue recovery. The intended objectives of improved access
		  to the operating theater were realized along with the added
		  benefit of significant cost savings and convenience to
		  hospital personnel and surgical recovery teams. }

  abstract	= {CONTEXT: Efforts to increase organ donation include
		  serious attempts in hospital settings, where unrealized
		  donation potential exists. Research on hospital donation
		  must include understanding organizational as well as
		  patient-specific influences on the donation process.
		  OBJECTIVE: To identify organizational characteristics that
		  distinguish hospitals producing organ donations from those
		  that do not, and to estimate the number of nondonor
		  hospitals with donor potential. DESIGN: Data from the
		  American Hospital Association's 1992 annual survey of
		  hospitals were matched to Organ Procurement and
		  Transplantation Network information from the United Network
		  for Organ Sharing regarding the number of solid-organ
		  donors in 1992. Hospitals with donation capability were
		  identified, based on bed size and factors necessary to
		  produce successful donor maintenance and organ recovery.
		  Based on statistical analyses, organizational
		  characteristics distinguishing donor hospitals from
		  nondonor hospitals were identified. We also compared the
		  number of donors and the number of donor hospitals in 1992
		  and 1996. SETTING: United States. RESULTS: Among all
		  hospitals affiliated with the American Hospital Association
		  (n = 5607), 1214 (22\%) were identified as donor hospitals
		  (> or = 1 donation in 1992). Of 2333 hospitals with
		  procurement capability, 1268 (54\%) produced no donors in
		  1992. Based on a multiple logistic regression model, donor
		  hospitals differed from nondonor hospitals by hospital
		  ownership, with municipally owned hospitals more likely and
		  federally owned hospitals less likely to produce donation,
		  compared with for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals.
		  Other organizational characteristics associated with donor
		  hospitals were level of trauma services, whether the
		  hospital had a transplant surgery program or a hospital
		  ethics committee, and whether it was located in the South
		  Atlantic, Southwest Central, or Pacific regions of the
		  United States. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitals not currently
		  producing organ donations, there is a sizable subgroup with
		  donor potential. This area merits further attention.}

		  organs, especially kidneys, for the purpose of
		  transplantation. This shortfall is especially remarkable in
		  African American populations. Because the incidence of
		  hypertension (HTN) and associated end-stage renal diseases
		  (ESRD) is 17 times greater in African Americans, this
		  minority group, which comprises only 12\% of the U.S.
		  population, represents 34\% of the dialysis population and
		  30\% of the national kidney waiting list. Furthermore,
		  while black individuals comprise 22-24\% of kidney
		  recipients, they comprise only 8-11\% of donors. Because of
		  the histocompatibility differences between the races and
		  because tissue matching is part of the United Network for
		  Organ Sharing (UNOS) allocation formula, African Americans
		  wait twice as long for kidneys as Caucasians. Also, because
		  they get more poorly matched organs, their kidney
		  transplant graft survival is 10-20\% lower than that for
		  other racial groups. The African American community is
		  unaware of the special needs in members of their own race.
		  Steps must be taken to increase minority awareness of the
		  need for well-matched transplant organs and their
		  involvement in the donation process.},

  abstract	= {CONTEXT: Transplantation has become the therapy of choice
		  for patients with organ failure. However, the low rate of
		  consent by families of donor-eligible patients is a major
		  limiting factor in the success of organ transplantation.
		  OBJECTIVE: To explore factors associated with the decision
		  to donate among families of potential solid organ donors.
		  DESIGN AND SETTING: Data collection via chart reviews,
		  telephone interviews with health care practitioners (HCPs)
		  or organ procurement organization (OPO) staff, and
		  face-to-face interviews with family for all donor-eligible
		  deaths at 9 trauma hospitals in southwestern Pennsylvania
		  and northeastern Ohio from 1994 to 1999. PARTICIPANTS:
		  Family members, HCPs, and OPO staff involved in the
		  donation decision for 420 donor-eligible patients. MAIN
		  OUTCOME MEASURE: Factors associated with family decision to
		  donate or not donate organs for transplantation. RESULTS: A
		  total of 238 of the 420 cases led to organ donation; 182
		  did not. Univariate analysis revealed numerous factors
		  associated with the donation decision. Multivariable
		  analysis of associated variables revealed that family and
		  patient sociodemographics (ethnicity, patient's age and
		  cause of death) and prior knowledge of the patients' wishes
		  were significantly associated with willingness to donate
		  (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.68; 95\% confidence interval
		  [CI], 6.55-9.01). Families who discussed more topics and
		  had more conversations about organ donation were more
		  likely to donate (adjusted OR, 5.22; 95\% CI, 4.32-6.30),
		  as were families with more contact with OPO staff (adjusted
		  OR, 3.08; 95\% CI, 2.63-3.60) and those who experienced an
		  optimal request pattern (adjusted OR, 2.96; 95\% CI,
		  2.58-3.40). Socioemotional and communication variables
		  acted as intervening variables. CONCLUSIONS: Public
		  education is needed to modify attitudes about organ
		  donation prior to a donation opportunity. Specific steps
		  can be taken by HCPs and OPO staff to maximize the
		  opportunity to persuade families to donate their relatives'
		  organs. },

  optnote	= {Numerous studies document that women constitute the
		  majority of living kidney donors, but the reasons behind
		  the disparity in donation rates between men and women
		  remain obscure. We studied this issue by gathering data on
		  family members of living donor allograft recipients at a
		  single large center over a 5-year period (n = 144). By
		  considering all potential donors (spouses and first-degree
		  relatives) within each recipient's immediate family, we
		  determined that men and women are excluded as donors at
		  approximately similar rates on the basis of medical
		  condition or known blood group type A, type B, type O
		  incompatibility, and that a greater percentage of
		  acceptable female donors (28.3\%) compared with men
		  (20.3\%) go on to donate a kidney (P: = 0.027). However,
		  when only first-degree relatives are considered, the
		  difference in donation rate between men and women becomes
		  nonsignificant (26.9\% of women versus 22.2\% of men; P =
		  0.229). Among spouses, the gender disparity in donation
		  rate is greater (36\% of wives versus 6.5\% of husbands who
		  are acceptable donors go on to donate a kidney; P = 0.003).
		  Evidence that economic factors may contribute to the
		  overall gender disparity is also presented. In conclusion,
		  the gender disparity among living kidney donors observed in
		  our population can be largely attributed to an overwhelming
		  predominance of wives among spousal donors. Possible
		  explanations and potential interventions to address
		  underrepresentation of male donors are discussed.},
